# The Omnipendium

### What happened to the Grand Compendium of Information?
Good question. The GCOI was full of old, outdated, incomplete, and contradictory information. Much of it will be pulled forward into the Omnipendium, but not without heavy review.

### What is the purpose of this new Omnipendium?

Apart from being a reference for authors, game masters, and players alike, I also intend to eventually train a GPT like AI on the contents of the Omnipedia. I will then use this ai to transform "Excerpts from a book I'll never write" into a book actually written. I don't know how that's going to work yet, but I'll get there when I get there.
