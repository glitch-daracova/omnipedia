# Topics regarding The Long War

### **1. The Xaran Alliance and Its Structure**

- Origins of the **Xaran Alliance**: Xarans' rebellion and escape from the Vex Empire with the help of **Prism**.
- **Xaran Society**: Their live-fast-die-young philosophy, short lifespans, communal families, and emphasis on military service.
- **Xaran Architecture**: Preference for space cities over terrestrial worlds, particularly the city of **Neon**.
- **Neon**: The first Xaran space city, now the closest thing to an Alliance capital. Prism's central core is located there.

### **3. The Dreamscape**

- **The Dreamscape**: An interstitial realm similar to the Breach, accessible via **Dreamcatchers**.
- **Dreamcatchers**: Independently invented across species through a shared dreamlike vision. Dreamcatchers allow conscious navigation of the Dreamscape.

- **The Luminors Guild**: A prestigious guild managed by Prism, where elite players engage in tasks and raids that divert their attention from Prism’s operations.
- **Luminor Raids**: Biannual events that distract skilled dreamers and dreamrunners. These involve exploring new Dreamscape realms seeded by Prism with “grand dungeons.”

### **4. The Breach**

- **Breachfire**: A catastrophic and dangerous force that can be unleashed by accident or theoretically as a weapon. Both the Vex Empire and the Alliance avoid its use due to mutually assured destruction.

- **Avnari**: Long-lived bird-like beings, cultural godparents to some Xaran families.
- **Vespers**: Insectoid race with short-lived drones and long-lived monarchs. Monarchs often see parallels between their society and Xaran communalism.
