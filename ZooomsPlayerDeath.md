# In Event of Player Death
Return to: [**Zombie Outbreak on O'Mally Station**](ZombieOutbreakOnOMallyStation.md)

#### **Player Survivor Death**

- **Event**: If a player’s character (Player Survivor) dies during the game, that player is not immediately out of the game.
- **Trigger**: Upon death, the game pauses briefly to determine if there are any non-player survivors available to replace the fallen character.

#### **Replacement by Non-Player Survivor**

- **Eligibility**:
    - **Alive**: The non-player survivor must be alive at the time of the Player Survivor's death.
    - **Unplayed**: The non-player survivor must not already be assigned to another player. This means they are currently controlled by the game master or the game system itself.
- **Selection Process**:
    - **Closest Survivor**: The game master can choose the non-player survivor who is closest to the group or the one who is best suited to the current situation (e.g., if the group needs a medic, the game master might select a non-player with basic medical skills).
    - **Random Selection**: Alternatively, the game master could select a new Player Survivor randomly from the pool of eligible non-player survivors.
- **Transition**:
    - **In-Game Explanation**: The non-player survivor steps up in the narrative, taking on a more prominent role after witnessing the death of a key figure (the fallen player character). This transition can be accompanied by a brief story moment where the non-player survivor decides to take on more responsibility for the group’s survival.
    - **Character Sheet Transfer**: The player receives a new character sheet for the chosen non-player survivor, with stats, abilities, and any remaining resources the survivor has. This character becomes the new Player Survivor for that player.
    - **Morale Impact**: The death of the original Player Survivor may result in a Morale loss, reflecting the emotional toll on the group. However, the new Player Survivor's promotion may stabilize the situation, especially if they bring critical skills to the table.

#### **Continuing the Game**

- **Gameplay Continuity**: The player continues the game with the new character, inheriting the responsibilities and challenges of their role within the group.
- **New Objectives**: The new Player Survivor might have their own unique win conditions or might inherit the win conditions of the previous character. This keeps the game dynamic and adaptable to the unfolding narrative.
- **Resource Management**: The new Player Survivor may bring their own set of resources (such as Supplies, Ammo, or a personal air supply), potentially altering the group's resource management strategy.

### **Example Scenario**

- **Scenario**: James Rogue, the group’s engineer, dies while trying to repair the station’s life support system.
- **Replacement**: The game master checks the roster and finds that a non-player survivor, an NPC named Hannah (with basic technical skills), is nearby and not controlled by another player.
- **Transition**: The player controlling James now takes over Hannah, who steps up to try and complete the repair. The group suffers a temporary Morale loss due to James's death, but Hannah’s quick thinking and action may help stabilize the situation.
- **Gameplay Continuity**: The player continues as Hannah, who now becomes a key figure in the group’s survival, carrying on the group’s mission with a fresh perspective.

### **Impact on Gameplay**

- **Keeps Players Engaged**: This mechanic ensures that players remain active participants even if their original character dies, keeping the game enjoyable for everyone.
- **Dynamic Narrative**: The ability for non-player survivors to become new player characters adds to the narrative depth, as each survivor has their own story, skills, and personality that can change the group dynamics.
- **Strategic Depth**: Players may have to consider the potential of losing their character and the implications of who might take their place, adding another layer to their decision-making.
