**Background**: Kara "Echo Hawk" Vander was once a celebrated fighter pilot in the Terran Navy, known for her sharp reflexes and unmatched tactical acumen in the cockpit. Her callsign, Echo Hawk, was a tribute to her hawk-like vision and her ability to anticipate her enemies’ moves as if she could hear their thoughts.

After years of service, Kara grew disillusioned with military life and decided to retire early. She sold most of her belongings and bought a small, well-worn space camper, deciding to live a life of freedom, exploring the galaxy at her own pace. She enjoyed the quiet solitude of her new life, docking only when necessary for repairs or supplies, and rarely staying in one place for long.

A day before the outbreak on O'Mally Station, Kara docked for emergency repairs, intending to leave as soon as her camper was spaceworthy again. The outbreak trapped her on the station, forcing her to use all her skills to survive and protect the few people she encountered.

**Notable Events**:

- **Zombie Outbreak on O'Mally Station**: When the outbreak began, Kara quickly realized that the situation was beyond normal protocol. She fortified her camper as a fallback point but soon found herself drawn into the station’s chaos, using her piloting and combat skills to assist in the fight for survival. Her knowledge of the station’s layout from her short time there became invaluable in navigating the increasingly dangerous environment.

**Motivation**: Kara is motivated by a deep-seated need to survive and a lingering sense of duty from her military days. While she prefers her independence, the outbreak has reignited her protective instincts, driving her to help those who can’t defend themselves. She is determined to get off the station alive, but not without doing what she can for the other survivors.

**Current Status**: Kara is actively assisting the survivors on O'Mally Station, using her skills to navigate the station, fight off threats, and find a way to repair her camper for a quick escape. She remains focused and composed, though she knows that time is running out and that she may have to make hard decisions to ensure her survival.
