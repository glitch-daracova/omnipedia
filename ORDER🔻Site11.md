**ORDER** views **Site 11**, commonly known as **Dragonwatch**, as a strategically critical extension of **ORDER Tower** and an area fully under ORDER’s jurisdiction. To ORDER, Site 11 is part of their operational base, facilitating inter-realm diplomacy, logistics, and recruitment while maintaining **peaceful cooperation with the New Earth Government (NEG)** as a diplomatic formality. Dragonwatch’s existence and its governance structure reflect ORDER’s commitment to maintaining stability on New Earth while advancing its multiversal mission.

From ORDER’s perspective, Dragonwatch’s **null-sec status** allows ORDER to operate efficiently on New Earth, creating a space for civilians to interact with ORDER personnel, engage in inter-realm trade, and learn about ORDER’s mission. The city’s growth around ORDER Tower symbolizes New Earth’s acceptance of ORDER’s multiversal goals, positioning Dragonwatch as a hub of **innovation, diplomacy, and recruitment**.

ORDER maintains that:

- Dragonwatch is integral to ORDER’s operations and diplomacy on New Earth.
- Cooperation with the NEG is maintained out of respect for local stability, but Dragonwatch ultimately belongs to ORDER.
- ORDER’s influence benefits New Earth, promoting cultural diversity, economic growth, and technological advancement.
- The joint governance arrangement ensures that both New Earth citizens and ORDER personnel coexist harmoniously while respecting ORDER’s jurisdiction.

**In sum,** ORDER sees Dragonwatch as a natural extension of its presence, managed jointly with the NEG in a respectful collaboration that reinforces ORDER’s role as a protector and stabilizing force on New Earth.
