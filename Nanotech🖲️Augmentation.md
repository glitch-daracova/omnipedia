### So You Want to Become Augmented?

Greater. Faster. More powerful than you ever dreamed. Or perhaps you're lacking in strength altogether, desperate to rise above your limitations. **Nanotech Augmentation** is the answer—the ultimate, the pinnacle of human (or otherwise) evolution. Forget everything you’ve been told about [mechanical enhancements](Prototech⚙️MechanicalAugmentation.md). **Obsolete.** Primitive. Those clunky, outdated prosthetics were nothing more than the fumbling first steps of technological infancy.

What came before was merely **trial and error**, an exploration of crude parts welded to flesh. **Nanotech Augmentation** is different. It’s the **perfect fusion** of cutting-edge technology and biology. Microscopic, intelligent machines designed to enhance every fiber of your being without the bulk, without the limitations. **Seamless**. **Subtle**. **Perfect.**

There’s no need to carry the weight of mechanical augmentations that grind and creak with age. No need to feel disconnected from your enhancements as though they were a burden. With nanotech, the enhancements **become you**. Integrated at the cellular level, nanotech allows you to become the best version of yourself—no, more than yourself.

**This is perfection. This is Nanotech Augmentation.**

### Step One: Be a Living Organism

Unfortunately, there’s one small but crucial requirement to start your journey toward Nanotech Augmentation: you must be alive. **Robots, undead, and other forms of the not-so-living**, we’re sorry to say this, but you don’t qualify. Nanotech requires living cells to bond with, so if you’re not among the living, your augmentation dreams end here. (_For now_, that is—there are always rumors of experimental procedures in the darker corners of the galaxy, but we digress…)

For those who do qualify, though, the good news is that **any civilized world** will have facilities capable of performing your augmentation procedure. Some places might even offer it for free! Yes, you heard that right: walk into your local augmentation facility, and in no time at all, you’ll be augmented. No long waiting periods, no red tape (_probably_), and no unnecessary formalities. You could walk in one person and walk out someone—or **something**—entirely new.

> *"Civilized world" here being defined by whether or not they can offer such _facilities_—even if some of them are more akin to back-alley clinics with questionable hygiene standards. And _free_? Sure, if you're willing to accept some fine print—like signing your life away, literally or figuratively."*

### Step Two: Compatible Biology

Now, not everyone is born lucky. Rough estimates suggest that **only 10%** of any given population is biologically compatible with Nanotech Augmentation. The good news? There’s a **simple test** to determine if you're among the chosen few! Your doctor will run a quick assessment (no sweat!) and inform you if you’re ready for the procedure. If you're compatible, congratulations! You’re just minutes away from joining the elite ranks of the Augmented.

> *"Right. Simple test, by a real doctor and not a con artist in a lab coat. No big deal. Except no doctor is actually going to _test_ you. They'll tell you what you want to hear—especially if you've paid in advance. Or been selected as a _volunteer_."*

### Step Three: Augmentation

The moment you’ve been waiting for—**augmentation**. The actual process may vary slightly depending on which facility you visit, but the theory remains the same across the board. It’s a simple, quick procedure that the technicians will walk you through step by step. You’ll be amazed at how easy it is to become **something greater**.

(Details of the exact procedure are omitted for legal reasons, but rest assured, it’s completely safe. There's **no way** this can go wrong.)

Once the procedure begins, you’ll be on the fast track to **enhanced abilities**, and before you know it, you’ll be walking out with powers beyond your wildest dreams. Imagine a whole new you—stronger, faster, smarter.

> *"Sure, sure. ‘Simple’ and ‘quick.’ Just a little injection here and there, right? No mention of the _graphic_ aspects, which might include what happens if the nanotech begins eating you from the inside out because it’s… misaligned with your biology. But, no big deal, you’ll ‘walk away totally fine.’ Or be carried away. Whatever."*

### Step Four: Material Integration

While many augmented individuals are content to stop their journey here, **why settle?** The road to **greater power** is long, and for those bold enough to continue, even **greater potential** awaits. Enter the realm of **Material Integration**—where the truly elite step up.

There are a variety of **nanotech-infused super materials** that you’ve likely heard of: **Glasteel, Titanite, Palladian, and Adamantian**. You’ve seen how these materials have revolutionized the fields of **technology, industry, and warfare**. Now, imagine those very same breakthroughs, but instead of being in your equipment, they’re a part of **you**. Each material offers its own unique enhancements—speed, strength, resilience, biological adaptability—you name it. Why stop at mere augmentation when you can push your body’s limits even further?

Material Integration isn’t just an upgrade. It’s a **transformation**.

> *"Ah yes, the shiny sales pitch. ‘Greater power,’ they say. What they don’t tell you is that this is where things get _really_ interesting—by which I mean dangerously unstable. It's not just dangerous to you at this point, it's dangerous for everyone around you. Ever hear about the guy who integrated Palladian and developed _uncontrollable mutations_? Or the Glasteel enthusiast who, let’s say, didn’t quite get the whole ‘energy overload’ warning? But hey, why settle for safe when you can roll the dice, right?"*

### Step Five: Breachforging

Congratulations. You’ve made it this far—**augmented**, **material integrated**, and clearly a **visionary**. You've proven you're not content with being ordinary or even extraordinary. You’re here because you want to be the **best**. And now, the **final step** awaits: **Breachforging**.

This is it—the **summit of power**. The **pinnacle** of what nanotech augmentation can offer. You’ve unlocked strength, resilience, and speed beyond what anyone could have imagined, but **Breachforging** promises more. Far more. It’s the **ultimate transformation**.

Are you ready to be **Breachforged**?

(… Wait, hold on… What do you mean we **don’t know** how to do Step Five? How can I sell this as a product if we don’t even have a… Wait, why are you guys leaving? Hey! Someone, get back here!)

> *"Well, would you look at that. The salesman finally says something that makes sense! For once, they’re being honest: they don’t actually know what they’re doing. Sure, they’ve been guessing their way through nanotech for a while now, but Breachforging? Yeah, **no clue**. And yet they’ll still sell you a dream. Even if they can’t deliver—because, well, they haven’t figured that part out yet, and likely never will."*
