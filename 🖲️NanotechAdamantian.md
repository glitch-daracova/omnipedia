#### **Production and Refinement**

**Mining:** Adamantian is extraordinarily rare and is most often found in large, **disk-like crystal formations** deep beneath planetary surfaces or in asteroid belts. Mining Adamantian is a challenging task, as it is almost impossible to break apart without using tools already made of Adamantian. **Specialized nanotech drills** and cutting tools are required to extract it without damaging its structure, making mining operations highly **costly** and **resource-intensive**.

**Refinement:** Refining Adamantian is an equally demanding process. Due to its sheer hardness, **nanotech-enhanced forges** are used to carefully shape the material into usable forms. These **nano-forges** can manipulate Adamantian at the molecular level, maintaining its integrity while giving it the desired shape. This process is usually only possible in **advanced industrial facilities** with highly specialized equipment.

**Shaping and Crafting:** Crafting with Adamantian requires a combination of **high-tech machinery** and **skilled artisans** who understand the material’s unique properties. Once refined, Adamantian can be shaped into tools, components, or structural supports, though this process is long and expensive due to the precision required to preserve the material’s unique strengths.
