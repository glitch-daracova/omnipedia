### Description

Million Hammer Plaza could be a vast, open area located at the heart of one of the megacities, a place where the city's energy converges. It's named after a historic event, the "Million Hammer Uprising," where a million citizens, armed only with hammers, rose up against an oppressive regime that once ruled the megacity with an iron fist. This plaza now stands as a symbol of resilience, freedom, and the collective power of humanity.
