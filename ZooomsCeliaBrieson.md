Return to: [**Zombie Outbreak on O'Mally Station**](ZooomsMain.md)

**Name**: Dr. Celia Brieson

**Race**: Human

**Gender**: Female

**Age**: 38 Terran Standard Years

**Class**: Scientist (PhD)

**Callsign**: Cool Breeze

**Notable Stories**:

- **Zombie Outbreak on O'Mally Station**

**Appearance**:

- **Height**: 5'7" (170 cm)
- **Build**: Slender and unassuming, with a wiry strength that belies her academic background.
- **Hair**: Silver-blonde, cut short and neatly styled, often kept tucked behind her ears for practicality.
- **Eyes**: Pale blue, with a calculating, almost clinical gaze that seems to see more than what’s on the surface.
- **Skin**: Fair, with a slight pallor from spending most of her time indoors, in labs, and under artificial lighting.

**Personality**:

- **Calm and Detached**: Dr. Celia Brieson, known as Cool Breeze, maintains an almost unnerving calm in any situation, approaching problems with clinical detachment.
- **Intellectually Driven**: Her curiosity and dedication to scientific discovery often override typical moral considerations, making her willing to experiment on patients if it advances her research.
- **Rational but Unpredictable**: While she’s highly logical, her thought process can be difficult to follow, leading her to make decisions that others might find shocking or unethical.
- **Confident and Independent**: She has little need for validation from others, relying instead on her deep knowledge and belief in her research.
- **Morally Ambiguous**: Celia is primarily concerned with advancing her understanding of human adaptability and mutation, and she views ethical concerns as secondary, especially in extreme situations.

**Skills and Abilities**:

- **Expertise in Human Mutation and Adaptability**: Celia’s research focuses on the limits and potentials of human evolution, particularly in response to extreme environments or stimuli. She’s an expert in genetic engineering and mutation studies.
- **Field Medicine**: Though not a medical doctor, Celia can perform emergency medical procedures, often improvising with whatever is at hand. Her methods might be unconventional, but they’re often effective.
- **Experimental Procedures**: Celia is skilled in conducting experiments that push the boundaries of human physiology, often using her knowledge to ‘enhance’ or modify individuals in ways that could be seen as dangerous or unethical.
- **Calm Under Pressure**: In high-stress situations, Celia remains composed, approaching problems with the same analytical mindset she uses in her research.

**Background**: Dr. Celia Brieson, known by her peers as Cool Breeze, earned her PhD with a groundbreaking thesis on "Human Adaptability and Mutation." Her unorthodox views and experiments, however, led her to clash with government regulations and academic oversight. Seeking a place where she could work without interference, she accepted an offer from the overseers of O'Mally Station, who provided her with a state-of-the-art lab to continue her research.

Celia’s work at O'Mally Station has always been shrouded in secrecy, with rumors of experiments that go far beyond accepted ethical boundaries. She views the outbreak on the station not just as a crisis, but as a unique opportunity to observe and influence human mutation in real-time.

**Notable Events**:

- **Zombie Outbreak on O'Mally Station**: During the outbreak, Celia has been both a potential savior and a potential threat. While she can patch up survivors, her primary interest lies in studying the mutations caused by the outbreak. Some survivors owe their lives to her interventions, but others have found themselves unwilling subjects of her experiments.

**Motivation**: Celia is driven by an insatiable curiosity about the human condition, particularly how extreme conditions can drive evolutionary change. The zombie outbreak on O'Mally Station presents her with a rare opportunity to study these changes firsthand. While she’s willing to help survivors, her true focus is on advancing her research, even if it means pushing ethical boundaries.

**Current Status**: Dr. Celia Brieson continues to operate out of her lab on O'Mally Station, using the chaos of the outbreak to further her experiments. She’s an ally to the other survivors, but one that is watched warily, as her methods and motivations are not entirely trustworthy. Her knowledge of mutation and adaptability could be key to understanding the outbreak—or it could make her the most dangerous person on the station.
