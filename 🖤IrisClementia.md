# üñ§ Iris Clementia, "The Absolver"

- **Affiliation**: [üèõHouseAthetosüñ§](üèõHouseAthetosüñ§.md)
- **Stone**: Moonstone
- **Power**: Forgiveness
- **Profile**: The goddess of absolution, Iris can forgive any sin‚Äîbut at a cost. Those she absolves are erased entirely, as if they never existed. Her powers make her both feared and revered, embodying the paradox of mercy and destruction.

#### Origins: The Goddess of Mercy

Iris Clementia is the **embodiment of forgiveness**, a goddess whose gentle demeanor contrasts sharply with the ruthless ambition of her peers in **House Athetos**. While others rule through strength, fear, or cunning, Iris prefers to resolve conflict through compassion and absolution. Her philosophy is simple: **forgive and forget**. However, Iris‚Äôs forgiveness is not without consequence‚Äîwhen she forgives, **everyone forgets**. Those she absolves are erased not just from memory but from existence itself, leaving only faint echoes in the fabric of reality.

#### The Forgotten Sky God

The mysterious sky god who once ruled Noct_yr alongside other deities is now **little more than a shadow** in the collective consciousness. His name, deeds, and legacy have been wiped away, leaving only scattered rumors and vague recollections of a once-great power. Iris‚Äôs role in his downfall is both deliberate and paradoxical:

- **A Silent Mercy**: When the rebellion led by **Leroy Tyrannus** reached its peak, Iris confronted the sky god not with violence but with her unique gift. She forgave his transgressions, and in doing so, erased his existence from the multiverse‚Äôs memory.
- **A Controversial Act**: Some in House Athetos view her absolution as the **ultimate betrayal** of the rebellion‚Äôs struggle, while others see it as an act of poetic justice. For Iris, it was a necessary step toward a future unburdened by the past.

#### Forgiveness as Power

Iris‚Äôs power to **absolve and erase** is both her greatest strength and her deepest burden. While she wields her ability sparingly, every act of forgiveness reshapes the multiverse, removing individuals, events, and histories from its tapestry.

- **The Weight of Mercy**: Iris does not absolve lightly, knowing that her actions create **irreversible voids**. She often grapples with the moral implications of her power, questioning whether true mercy lies in forgiveness or in allowing the weight of history to remain.
- **Pacifist, Not Passive**: Despite her gentle nature, Iris is far from weak. Her ability to erase existence itself makes her a fearsome presence, though she avoids direct confrontation whenever possible.

#### A Goddess Apart

Iris‚Äôs role in **House Athetos** is one of quiet support and subtle influence. She prefers to remain in the background, offering counsel and compassion to her peers, even when they reject it. Her pacifism often places her at odds with the more aggressive members of the House, but her ability to resolve conflicts without violence has earned her a begrudging respect.

- **Isolation**: Her power isolates her from others, as even her allies fear the consequences of her forgiveness. This distance, while painful, allows her to maintain a neutral perspective within the House.
- **A Voice of Reason**: In the heated debates and rivalries of House Athetos, Iris often serves as the **voice of reason**, advocating for restraint and understanding.

#### Strengths and Weaknesses

- **Strengths**: Iris‚Äôs power to absolve and erase makes her nearly untouchable. Her compassion and wisdom allow her to navigate even the most volatile situations with grace.
- **Weaknesses**: Her pacifism and reluctance to act can be perceived as weakness, leaving her vulnerable to manipulation or sidelining in critical moments.

#### Legacy and Influence

To the people of Noct_yr, Iris Clementia is both a savior and a specter. Her acts of forgiveness have reshaped the realm‚Äôs history, erasing both enemies and allies in equal measure. While her compassion inspires devotion, her power instills fear, as even her closest followers know they could be wiped from existence with a single act of mercy.

Within **House Athetos**, Iris is a paradox: a goddess of peace in a pantheon of power-hungry deities. Her presence tempers the House‚Äôs more destructive tendencies, yet her ability to erase history serves as a chilling reminder of the cost of forgiveness. For Iris, the burden of her power is both a curse and a calling‚Äîa reminder that even gods must wrestle with the consequences of mercy.
