# Vexian Empire

#### Description
The Vexian Empire is a powerful and expansive force in the galaxy, primarily composed of the Vex, a bipedal lizard-like species. They are a proud warrior race with a strong religious culture and a capitalist economy. The Vex believe they are the descendants of dragons and await the rebirth of their sun god, Sol Luxor. This belief deeply influences their society, with dawn being a sacred time for prayer, and the Temple of the Sun on their frozen homeworld, Va, serving as a central pilgrimage site. Ships in space synchronize their clocks to the Temple of the Sun to observe the holy hour of dawn.

#### Leadership
Emperor Solren Vexaris is the current prophet of Sol Luxor and the supreme leader of the Vexian Empire. Rising from the church, he became a true prophet and gained immense influence, leading to a bloodless coup where he took power. His council of advisors is a mix of sycophants, true believers, corporate representatives, world delegates, and priests, all vying for his favor. Council sessions are meticulously documented by scribes to ensure every word of the emperor is recorded and integrated into religious doctrine.

#### Religion and Beliefs
The Vex worship Sol Luxor, a disgraced sun god, and believe their sacrifices aid in his rejuvenation. They await the day of his rebirth, when they will ascend with him to a higher plane of existence. Dawn is a sacred time, marked by daily prayers, and witnessing the sunrise is crucial. Key religious festivals include Sol's Day, celebrated on Va's summer solstice with feasting, and Sol's Night, a universal day of rest.

#### Economy
The Vexian Empire operates under a capitalist system, with corporations running freely as long as they pay tithes to the church. Conquered races, such as the Corti, often manage these corporations, contributing to the empire's wealth. The Corti are known for their intelligence and play a crucial role in technological research and development.

#### Technology and Warfare
The Vexian Empireâ€™s technology, particularly their Plasma Tek weapons, combines elements of heat, electric, toxic, and psychic damage, making them formidable in warfare. The origins of their technology are uncertain, with some attributing it to divine inspiration. Notable pieces of technology like the Dreamcatcher, a device that captures and manipulates dreams, are believed to be independently invented by various civilizations around the same time. Famous scientists such as Dr. Saryn Threx and Engineer Vox Lumis have made significant contributions to refining these technologies.

#### Military History
The Vexian Empire's history is marked by numerous wars of expansion, similar to the Roman Empire's conquests but on an interplanetary scale. Key conflicts include the Battle of Lyris IV and the Siege of Zarkon Prime, where their advanced technology and strategic use of religious fervor played pivotal roles. Vex military strategies often involve boosting morale through their warriors' belief in divine blessing, making them a formidable force.
