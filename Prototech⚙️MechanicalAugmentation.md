# Mechanical Augmentation

**Mechanical Augmentation**, also known as **Augmetics**, is the practice of enhancing or replacing parts of the human body (or other species' bodies) with **mechanical components**. Augmetics predate nanotech augmentation, and while advances in **nanotechnology** have led to the development of **more powerful augmentations**, mechanical augmentations remain popular due to their **accessibility**, **lower failure rates**, and **proven reliability**.

In industries where manual labor or hazardous environments are prevalent, mechanical augmentation has become essential for survival and efficiency. Despite the rise of **nanotech-augmented individuals**, mechanical augmentations are widely used across **Terra**, **Pluto**, and other industrial hubs in the **Sol System**. Augmetics range from simple prosthetics to complex, multi-functional systems that enhance the physical and sensory capabilities of the user.

### Types of Mechanical Augmentations

1. **Limb Replacement:**
    
    - **Prosthetic limbs** are the most common form of mechanical augmentation. These can range from simple, utilitarian replacements to highly advanced limbs with **enhanced strength**, **dexterity**, and integrated tools or weapons. They are typically wired into the userâ€™s **nervous system** to provide **seamless control** and **response times** close to natural limbs.
    - Workers in industries such as **mining**, **construction**, and **space exploration** often rely on reinforced augmetic limbs to handle **heavy loads**, operate **machinery**, or perform dangerous manual labor.
2. **Organ Augmentation:**
    
    - **Mechanical organs** are used to replace failing or damaged biological systems. Augmented **hearts**, **lungs**, and even **liver replacements** are common, offering enhanced **efficiency** and the ability to survive in **extreme environments**. Augmented lungs, for instance, may allow workers to breathe in **toxic atmospheres** without protective equipment.
    - These augmentations are particularly vital for workers in environments like **the Gas Cities of Jupiter and Saturn** or the **industrial zones of Pluto**, where exposure to hazardous chemicals and extreme conditions can be fatal without mechanical support.
3. **Sensory Augmentation:**
    
    - **Sensory augments** replace or enhance the body's natural sensory organs. **Augmented eyes** can include **night vision**, **thermal vision**, **multi-spectrum analysis**, or **zoom capabilities** for industrial or military applications. Similarly, **augmented ears** can amplify sound, filter out noise, or allow communication over great distances.
    - Sensory augmentation is common among **soldiers**, **engineers**, and **pilots**, who need heightened awareness and precision in their tasks.
4. **Combat Augmentations:**
    
    - For military and paramilitary forces, mechanical augmentation offers **tactical advantages**. **Armored limbs**, **reinforced spines**, and **integrated weapon systems** are common for soldiers deployed in dangerous or hostile environments. These augmentations are designed to provide **durability**, **firepower**, and **resilience** against physical trauma.
    - Combat augmetics are often modular, allowing soldiers to **swap components** or **add attachments** depending on the mission, such as hidden blades, grappling systems, or pulse emitters.

### Hybrid Augmentations: The Nanotech Bridge

As **nanotech augmentation** became more prevalent, a significant gap emerged between the capabilities of **mechanically augmented** individuals and those with **nanotech-enhanced bodies**. To address this, newer models of mechanical augmentations have begun incorporating **nanotech machinery** without directly interacting with the userâ€™s biological systems.

1. **Nanotech-Enhanced Augmetics:**
    
    - These hybrid augmentations use **nanotechnology** to enhance the performance of mechanical systems. For example, nanobots within a **prosthetic limb** can **self-repair** damage, **reinforce the structure**, or **optimize power output** under stress. This gives mechanical augmentations an **edge** in environments that would otherwise destroy conventional machinery.
    - By integrating **nanotech without biological contact**, these systems avoid the risks of **nanotech rejection**, making them safer for individuals who cannot undergo **full nanotech augmentation**.
2. **Modular Design and Flexibility:**
    
    - Hybrid augmetics offer greater **versatility** in both **functionality** and **maintenance**. **Modular components** can be attached to mechanical limbs, offering the user customization based on their needs. For instance, a mining worker could swap out a **heavy-lifting prosthetic** for a **precision tool** at the end of their shift.
    - The use of nanotech in maintenance also means that hybrid augmentations require **less downtime** for repairs, making them ideal for **combat zones** or **hazardous industrial environments** where time is of the essence.

### Economic and Social Implications

1. **Debt-Driven Augmentation:**
    
    - Mechanical augmentations, though more affordable than nanotech augmentations, are still **cost-prohibitive** for many workers in hazardous industries. On **Terra** and **Pluto**, financing augmetics through **loans** or **payment plans** is common, with many workers going into **debt** just to obtain the mechanical augmentations necessary for employment.
    - For most workers, failure to repay these loans can result in **repossession** of their augmetics, which can be **crippling** or even **lethal**. This has led to a **cycle of debt** where workers must constantly upgrade or repair their augmentations, often leaving them financially trapped. The practice of **brain shelving** is a last resort for individuals who can no longer afford to pay off their augmentation debt.
2. **Class Divide:**
    
    - A clear **divide** exists between those who use mechanical augmentations and those who are enhanced with **nanotech**. Nanotech augmentation is often seen as a **status symbol** for the wealthy and elite, while mechanical augmentation is associated with the **working class**, particularly those in **manual labor** or **combat roles**.
    - In some areas, **mechanical augmentation** is seen as a **relic of the past**, while **nanotech** is considered the **future of human evolution**. This has led to tensions in societies where mechanically augmented individuals are treated as **second-class citizens**, despite their essential contributions to the economy.

### The Legal and Corporate Landscape

1. **Corporate Control:**
    
    - Large corporations have a **monopoly** over the production, sale, and financing of augmetics, making them essential players in both **industrial** and **military sectors**. On planets like **Pluto** and **Mars**, corporations dictate not only the **designs** of augmetics but also the terms under which they are financed and repaired.
    - Some corporations specialize in creating **combat augmetics**, selling them to private military contractors or governments, while others focus on **industrial augmetics**, ensuring workers are equipped to handle hazardous environments. Corporations that offer **financing plans** to workers essentially become **augmentation lords**, controlling access to these life-saving devices and profiting from **long-term debt contracts**.
2. **Black Market Augments:**
    
    - Due to the **high cost** of legal augmetics, **black markets** for **cheaper augmentations** and **illegal modifications** have sprung up in many parts of the Sol System. These black market augmetics are often built from **salvaged parts** or **inferior components**, making them less reliable but much more affordable for those who canâ€™t afford corporate-financed augmetics.
    - Black market augmentations come with significant **risks**. Many are **prone to failure**, and others may be **unregistered** or **untraceable**, making maintenance difficult. In some cases, black market augmentations may also come with **hacks** or **backdoors** that allow external control, leading to dangerous scenarios.
3. **Legal Regulations:**
    
    - Most jurisdictions impose **strict regulations** on the use of mechanical augmentations, particularly in **combat** and **military sectors**. Augmetics used for **civilian purposes** are subject to frequent inspections and must meet certain **safety standards**. However, loopholes in these regulations often allow corporations to exploit workers, particularly those in **high-risk environments** like **deep space mining** or **industrial manufacturing**.
    - **Repossession** of augmetics is legally sanctioned in most territories, with **repo crews** dispatched to collect augmetics from individuals who have fallen behind on payments. These repossessions are often **violent**, leaving individuals crippled or worse, and have become a point of contention among labor rights groups. The end result of which is often [Brain Shelving](PrototechðŸ§ BrainShelving.md).

### Cultural and Psychological Impact

1. **The Value of the Mechanically Augmented:**
    
    - In some cultures, individuals with mechanical augmentations are seen as **stronger**, more **resilient**, and **hard-working**. These individuals often take pride in their augments, viewing them as a sign of their ability to survive and thrive in the face of adversity. For these people, mechanical augmentation is a symbol of their **independence** and **practicality**.
    - In other societies, mechanically augmented individuals are viewed as **outdated** or **inferior**, especially when compared to nanotech-augmented elites. This can lead to feelings of **insecurity** or **social division**, as the augmented working class feels increasingly alienated from the rest of society.
2. **Psychological Adaptation:**
    
    - The psychological impact of using mechanical augmentations can vary. Some individuals seamlessly adapt to their augmentations, incorporating them into their self-identity, while others experience **phantom limb syndrome**, **detachment**, or even **body dysmorphia** as a result of the disconnect between their biological and mechanical parts.
    - For many, the transition to **full-body augmentation** can be psychologically traumatic, particularly in cases where augments are imposed through necessity (e.g., following an accident). Support groups and **mental health programs** for augmented individuals are essential in helping them cope with the emotional burden of losing their natural body parts.
