Kinetic is basic physical damage, for when an object strikes another object. If a damage type isn't specified, it's probably this. Nothing that exists physically can be immune to kinetic damage.

Other common damage types include Heat, Cold and Electric, of these I don't think any need explanation.

Toxic damage is an umbrella for anything poisonous or corrosive. This includes acids, venoms, diseases, radiation, and more. Despite wildly varying methods, these are all considered 'toxic'. Because of these wildly varying methods, nothing that exists physically can be totally immune to toxic damage. Instead, there can only be resistances/immunities to specific sources of toxic damage.

Psychic damage doesn't hurt physically, it hurts the mind. If a difficult puzzle has ever left your head hurting, you've experienced psychic damage from a mnemonic agent. An image of impossible geometry that kills anyone who looks at it does so with psychic damage. All creatures with a mind, be it organic or digital, are susceptible to psychic damage.
