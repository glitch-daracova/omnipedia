### **God Kings and Kings of Gods: Supreme Divine Authority**

**This page is to be split into two separate pages for the two topics.**

In the multiverse, a **God King** or **King of Gods** is a deity who has risen to the pinnacle of divine hierarchy within a specific realm, pantheon, or cluster of realms. These figures possess unmatched power and influence, serving as the ultimate rulers over other gods, mortals, and sometimes even the laws of reality within their dominion. However, the nature of this title—and what it represents—varies widely depending on the god, their rise to power, and the circumstances of their rule.

### **Definition and Nature**

- **God King**: A deity who rules as the supreme authority over a specific pantheon or realm. Their rule may be solitary or supported by subordinate gods and divine hierarchies.
- **King of Gods**: A broader and often more ambitious title, implying rule not only over their own pantheon but over the entire multiverse of gods. While few claim this title legitimately, many strive for it, seeing it as the ultimate expression of divinity.

### **Paths to Supreme Power**

A God King typically ascends to their throne through one or more of the following methods:

1. **Conquest of Divinity**: By defeating and absorbing the power of rival gods, a mortal or lesser god can claim ultimate authority. (e.g., **Kaiser Phobos** of Aeth_yr).
2. **Faith Unification**: By becoming the focal point of worship across multiple regions or realms, a god consolidates power and subjugates lesser deities.
3. **Inheritance**: Some God Kings inherit their role through divine lineage or a structured pantheon succession.
4. **Emergent Supremacy**: Gods who embody foundational concepts (e.g., life, death, or time) naturally rise to dominance as their influence is universal and absolute.

### **Traits of God Kings**

- **Absolute Power**: A God King wields unparalleled power within their domain, able to bend reality and dictate the rules of existence.
- **Divine Hierarchy**: They command other gods, often demanding loyalty, tribute, or submission from their subordinates.
- **Multiversal Influence**: While most God Kings are bound to their realms, many extend their influence across other realms through emissaries, champions, or inter-realm gates.
- **Imposing Presence**: A God King’s essence is overwhelming; their mere presence can inspire awe, fear, or worship in mortals and lesser gods alike.

### **Challenges of the Throne**

While a God King’s power is immense, their position comes with significant burdens and threats:

1. **Faith Dependency**: As with all gods, their strength is tied to belief. A faltering faith base can destabilize even the mightiest God King.
2. **Rebellion and Rivalries**: Subordinate gods may conspire to overthrow their ruler, while rival God Kings may wage war to claim supremacy.
3. **Responsibility and Balance**: The demands of ruling a realm or pantheon are immense, requiring constant attention to maintain harmony and power.
4. **External Threats**: Forces beyond divinity, such as the **Breach**, **eldritch entities**, or mortal heroes with divine aspirations, may challenge a God King’s rule.

### **Examples of God Kings**

1. **Kaiser Phobos, Lord of Fear and Killer of Gods (Aeth_yr)**
    
    - **Method of Ascension**: Phobos attained his title by slaying the old pantheon and unifying the realms under his reign of terror.
    - **Nature of Rule**: His empire thrives on fear as both worship and governance, ensuring his divinity remains strong and unchallenged.
2. **Leroy Tyrannus, King of Noct_yr**
    
    - **Method of Ascension**: A mortal hero who gathered allies and overthrew the old gods, claiming their domains for himself.
    - **Nature of Rule**: Leroy’s reign is built on a combination of charisma, raw power, and a carefully cultivated image of invincibility.
3. **Agrella (Potential God Queen of Elys_ium)**
    
    - **Potential Supremacy**: If Agrella were to consolidate faith across Elys_ium, her domain over life could elevate her to ultimate rulership. Her active role among her followers gives her a strong advantage.

### **God Kings and the Multiverse**

The ambition of a God King often extends beyond their home realm, as their status is inherently competitive. Some seek to unite multiple pantheons or realms, while others aim to ascend as **King of Gods**, claiming supremacy over the entire multiverse.

#### **Obstacles to Multiversal Supremacy**

- **Divine Resistance**: Other gods and pantheons fiercely oppose attempts to impose a singular rule over the multiverse.
- **Existential Balance**: Forces like the Breach or ancient laws of the cosmos may resist centralizing power, ensuring no single god can dominate all existence.
- **Internal Conflict**: The spark of divinity is inherently tied to individuality and autonomy, making gods difficult to unify or subjugate.
