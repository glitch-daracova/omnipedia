# The Breach: The Source of Nanotech
> Return to: [Nanotech Main](Nanotech🖲️Main.md)

Millions of years before humanity’s rise, **rifts** in the fabric of space-time allowed **wild nanotech** from the **Breach** to creep into Material Reality. These rifts, which usually closed on their own, seeded **nanomaterials** across the universe, bonding with inanimate matter and giving birth to materials like **glasteel**, **titanite**, and others. For aeons, these processes went unnoticed by intelligent life, slowly forming deposits of nanomaterials in planets, asteroids, and deep space.

# The Second Renaissance: Humanity’s Discovery of Nanotech

During the **Second Renaissance** on **Terra**, a golden age of scientific achievement following a long period of stagnation, **Dr. Elena Vargass** of **Future Factory** made a monumental discovery that changed the course of history. She uncovered the existence of the **Breach**, an interdimensional phenomenon, and was the first to intentionally harness **wild nanotech**. Using a **glasteel wafer**, she successfully created the first **Quantum Breach Processor**.

This **Quantum Breach Processor** revolutionized computation, allowing for near-infinite calculations by drawing on the power of the **Breach** itself. It became the foundation for all **modern nanotech** and the basis for **Breach Drives**, which enabled faster-than-light travel through controlled dimensional shortcuts. This era marked humanity’s leap into the stars and the beginning of a **galactic expansion**, with the **Quantum Breach Processor** at the core of all future technologies.
