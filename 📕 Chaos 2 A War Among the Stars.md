I wake up on board an alien ship, many light years away from home. Weeks have passed, and what little I remember makes me glad that I don't recall the rest. Myself, and about twelve others are the survivors of a series of ruthless experiments by [[🔷 Corti| Corti scientists]], who aimed to discover the effects of humans to an anomalous artifact. That's right, they didn't care about us, they only cared about it.

During a sudden attack on the ship, a psychic voice directs us to escape. This voice belongs to [[🔺 Prism| Prism]], a super-advanced AI able to communicate with us via our newly acquired nano-augmentations. These augmentations have been growing inside us as a result of the experiments.

We were rescued by a group of rebels. They called themselves the [[🏛 Xaran Alliance 🔺| Xaran Alliance]], and [[🔺 Prism| Prism]] is their leader. They're at war with the evil [[🏛 Vexian Empire 🔷| Vexian Empire]], and ask me to help. I undergo rigorous training at the hands of one [[🔺 Draco Knightslayer| Draco Knightslayer]]. I was already a fighter, but he turned me into a soldier. I went with it, of course. I believed it was all just another game in the [[🌌 Dreamscape| dreamscape]].

The main plot revolves around a daring mission to destroy a Vexian super-weapon, a laser cannon capable of blowing up planets. To my shock, I recognize the moon-sized space station the laser cannon is mounted to as the same I was rescued from not so long ago. The mission isn't just to destroy the gun, but to obliterate the entire station.

At the last possible moment, it occurs to me: "Are we the baddies?" After all, this was a research station, not just a military one. Not everyone on board was a combatant.

The mission is a success, but comes at a terrible cost. Civilian casualties are high, and I'm a war criminal now. I am also dead, which prevents me from confronting the brutal reality of my actions and the consequences of.
