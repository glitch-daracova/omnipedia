In the context of ORDER, **NPCs (No Profound Class)** are individuals brought in to perform essential, routine tasks that support ORDERâ€™s infrastructure and day-to-day operations. Unlike operatives or specialized personnel, NPCs are typically non-augmented individuals with minimal training in advanced multiversal skills, and they occupy roles that donâ€™t require extensive security clearance or specialized expertise.

NPCs may be recruited from a variety of backgrounds, including civilian applicants or even individuals selected from overcrowded prison systems. In such cases, NPC recruits are given amnestic treatments to erase memories of their former lives, allowing them a second chance and a fresh start within ORDER. NPCs primarily hold **Level 1 clearance**, which allows them to access Low Security (Lo-Sec) areas within ORDER facilities, though some NPCs may gain Level 2 clearance for training or education functions.

**Roles and Responsibilities of NPCs**:

- **Support and Maintenance**: NPCs often work in custodial, maintenance, and operational support roles, keeping ORDERâ€™s facilities running smoothly.
- **Commerce and Hospitality**: Many NPCs run small businesses within Lo-Sec and Null-Sec zones, providing ORDER personnel with services and amenities like cafes, shops, and recreation areas.
- **Basic Administrative Functions**: In some cases, NPCs perform entry-level administrative tasks, freeing up specialized personnel to focus on high-priority or classified work.

While NPCs are not directly involved in high-risk missions or sensitive research, they are a vital part of ORDERâ€™s ecosystem, maintaining a stable foundation that allows ORDER operatives to focus on multiversal protection and containment. NPCs have the opportunity to learn new skills within ORDER, and upon leaving, they receive full amnestic treatment, ensuring that they retain no knowledge of ORDERâ€™s classified operations. For NPCs, service within ORDER often represents a new beginning and a chance to contribute to a cause greater than themselves.
