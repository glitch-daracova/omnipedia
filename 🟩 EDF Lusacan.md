When the Imperium's prey Despairs at their helplessness is Lusacan's domain; to feed on the Despair and spread it till Submission is achieved. Whether it is stealing a holy relic from a kingdom, torturing imprisoned willful beings, or killing an inspiring leader in front of their company, Lusacanâ€™s joy is to destroy any source of Hope of the enemy.

Out of the Seven, Lusacan is the most involved in the affairs of mortals since Hope grows like a stubborn weed as long as life exists. He is known to bestow his favor as well as his personal assistance onto Cultists that plague other religions and their followers.
