**Background**: Gregory Montero was never meant to be a hero. Born into a comfortable life on Earth, he climbed the corporate ladder through shrewd decision-making and a network of connections. Eventually, he landed the cushy position of Station Overseer on O'Mally Station. His job was mostly administrative, ensuring the station ran smoothly while others handled the technical and operational challenges.

However, when the zombie outbreak occurred, Gregory found himself in a position where his usual tactics of delegation and persuasion were less effective. With the station falling apart, he struggled to maintain his authority, relying heavily on his access codes and knowledge of the station's systems to stay relevant and, more importantly, alive.

**Notable Events**:

- **Zombie Outbreak on O'Mally Station**: During the outbreak, Gregory's initial attempts to manage the situation from his office quickly fell apart as the crisis escalated beyond his control. He was forced to leave the safety of his command center and interact more directly with the station’s crew and survivors, often using his access codes to secure critical resources or escape from danger.

**Motivation**: Gregory is motivated primarily by self-preservation. He knows he’s not equipped to fight off zombies or repair critical systems, but he understands that his access codes and station knowledge are valuable assets. His goal is to leverage these to ensure his survival and maintain as much of his comfortable lifestyle as possible, even in the midst of chaos.

**Current Status**: Gregory Montero is currently trying to align himself with the strongest survivors on the station, including James Rogue and Marcus Greenwood. He’s aware that without real skills, his best chance at survival is to make himself indispensable by providing access to secure areas, critical systems, and any remaining resources on O'Mally Station.
