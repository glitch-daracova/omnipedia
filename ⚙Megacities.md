Made popular on [🌎Terra](🌎Terra.md), but also built on other worlds. Megacities are connected and interconnected structures that resemble ordinary cities, but are hundreds of miles across and reach upwards a mile or four at major centers. Usually separated into an undercity and uppercity.

On Terra, megacities are completely enclosed, due to the outside air being toxic and sunlight burning to the point of quick lethality.

Undercities never see daylight, regardless of what planet their on. Full of the lower and lowest class people, undercities are dark, dirty, and dangerous. If it weren't for the necessary foundations and infrastructure, those who run the uppercities would prefer to forget about the undercities.

Uppercities are generally better maintained, and full of higher class people. Uppercities feature luxurious apartments, recreational facilities, parks, and other things that undercity dwellers can only dream of.
