# Megacities

Megacities are sprawling, interconnected urban giants, first made popular on [Terra](SolðŸŒŽTerra.md) but now found on many other worlds. Unlike traditional cities, these colossal structures stretch across hundreds of miles and soar upward, with their central towers reaching heights of one to four miles. Each megacity is a labyrinth of interwoven districts, divided into two distinct realms: the **Undercity** and the **Uppercity**.

On Terra, megacities are fully enclosed structures, sealed off from the lethal environment outside. The atmosphere is toxic, and exposure to sunlight is fatal within minutes, making life beyond the protective walls impossible. As a result, the megacities have become the last bastions of life on the planet.

**Undercities**

The **Undercity** never sees daylight, regardless of the world on which the megacity is built. These shadowy depths house the lowest tiers of society, where poverty, crime, and neglect are rampant. Crumbling infrastructure, dim artificial lights, and a constant haze of pollution make the undercity a dangerous and unforgiving place. The inhabitants live in squalor, their existence a harsh reminder of the stark class divide. Despite its importance as the foundation for the upper layers of the cityâ€”housing essential workers, machinery, and infrastructureâ€”the undercity is a world the elites would prefer to ignore.

**Uppercities**

In stark contrast, the **Uppercity** is a realm of privilege and luxury. Towering above the smog and filth of the undercity, it is home to the wealthy and powerful. Gleaming skyscrapers, opulent apartments, and sprawling recreational facilities fill the skyline, while well-maintained parks and green spaces offer a taste of nature that those below can only dream of. The uppercityâ€™s residents enjoy a life of comfort, shielded from the hardships below by both physical and social barriers. It is a world where the elite live in comfort, rarely considering the suffering that sustains their way of life.
