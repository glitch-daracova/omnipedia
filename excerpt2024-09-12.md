# The Warp, The Void, and The Breach

*The Esteemed Grand Philosopher Alistair Vaincourt*

_Interstitial Realms for the Absolute Beginner_

The Warp, The Void, and The Breach are "Interstitial Realms"—planes of not-quite-existence that brush against our universe in ways both spectacular and dangerous. You might be asking, “What does that even mean?” or “How do we know this?” Rest assured, I’ll answer both questions. But first, let me assure you that _I_ am perfectly qualified to explain all of this. After all, few possess my level of intellectual sophistication—or my stubborn desire to survive the absurdity of these realms. (More on that later.)

Interstitial realms are a popular field of study due to their seemingly limitless potential for practical applications: faster-than-light travel, biological enhancement, devastating weaponry, etc. Yet, what most people fail to understand is that their allure is matched only by their lethality.

Let me introduce you to the three most infamous interstitial realms.

### The Warp

Let’s start with the one you're probably most familiar with: **The Warp**. This is a place that isn’t just dangerous—it’s actively hostile. Filled with hatred for all living things and armed with a wicked sense of humor, the Warp is less a place and more a malevolent entity. Tentacles, teeth, eyes, and madness—all of it seemingly designed to mess with your sanity. The Warp might help you… but only to betray you at the worst possible moment.

Imagine sailing a dinghy through a hurricane while sharks circle below and nuclear submarines stalk you from the depths. That's what traveling the Warp feels like. It’s chaos given form, and it _will_ devour you eventually—assuming you last that long.

### The Void

Then there's **The Void**, which, unlike the Warp, couldn’t care less about you. It is intelligent, yes, but indifferent to your existence. Picture a cosmic entity staring off into the distance, with thoughts too alien to comprehend, yet possessing some inscrutable ambition. What that ambition is, nobody knows—maybe not even the Void itself.

Navigating the Void is eerily calm. It’s like driving down a highway late at night, no other cars in sight. You’ll probably get to your destination. But all it takes is one miscalculation—a moment of distraction from something greater—and you'll cease to exist, possibly in a way much worse than death. It’s not personal; it’s just the nature of the Void.

### The Breach

Lastly, we come to **The Breach**, which is neither intelligent nor indifferent—it’s simply chaotic. It follows orders, every order, from everyone who has ever given it a command. But therein lies the problem: it follows _all_ commands, all the time, without a care for what’s practical or safe. As you might imagine, this leads to an overwhelming storm of actions happening all at once, forever.

If you were foolish enough to try and traverse the Breach, it would be like strolling through the surface of the sun while wearing only your shorts. You won’t last long, and you’ll be reduced to atoms—if you’re lucky. Unlike the Warp or Void, the Breach doesn’t hate you or ignore you. It simply doesn't have the capacity to care, and that indifference might be its scariest trait.

As you can see, each realm has its own unique dangers. The Warp is malicious, the Void is indifferent, and the Breach is chaos incarnate. Navigating any of them is like juggling grenades—eventually, one’s going to explode. Proceed with extreme caution if you ever find yourself near these realms, or better yet, avoid them entirely. But if you're still curious (or reckless) enough to explore, at least you can’t say I didn’t warn you.
