The **Nano-Augmented** are individuals who have undergone the dangerous and transformative process of integrating **nanotechnology** into their bodies, giving them enhanced physical and cognitive abilities far beyond those of unaugmented beings. The initial process of augmentation involves fusing **wild nanotech** with the subject's biology, a procedure that only a small fraction of individuals survive due to the strict requirement of **biological compatibility**.

For those who do survive, further enhancements can be achieved through a process known as **Material Integration**, where the Nano-Augmented can incorporate specialized **nanomaterials** into their body to gain new abilities. This optional upgrade comes with both **incredible power** and **significant risks**, depending on the chosen material.

Some Nano-Augmented individuals rely on **Fuel Gas** as their sole source of breathable air, using it to fuel their nanotech-driven bodies. While this grants impressive physical performance, it also creates a level of dependence that ties the augmented to a constant supply of this energy-rich substance.

#### **The Base Nano-Augmentation Process**

The initial step in becoming Nano-Augmented requires exposure to **wild nanotech**, a formless and chaotic nanomaterial that has the potential to fuse with the body. When this process is successful, the individual’s biology is radically altered, resulting in enhanced **strength**, **speed**, **endurance**, and **mental capacity**. Additionally, Nano-Augmented individuals gain the ability to interact directly with **nanotech systems**, enabling them to control **machines**, **weapons**, or even other augmented technologies with their mind.

However, surviving this process is highly unpredictable. If the individual’s biology is not compatible with wild nanotech, the procedure will lead to **rapid biological failure** and death. No test exists to determine compatibility beforehand—only survival confirms it.

#### **Material Integration: The Path to Greater Power**

After successful augmentation, the Nano-Augmented can choose to undergo an **optional upgrade** known as **Material Integration**, where specialized **nanomaterials** are incorporated into their body. Each nanomaterial brings **unique abilities** but also introduces specific **weaknesses** or **complications**. While Material Integration can greatly enhance an augmented individual’s capabilities, it is not without its dangers.

##### **Types of Material Integration:**

1. **Glasteel Integration:**
    
    - **Effects:** Enhances the augmented's **physical durability** and **heat resistance**, making them nearly impervious to both extreme heat and high-impact damage. They may also develop enhanced **electric conductivity**, allowing for the direct manipulation of energy-based weaponry or systems.
    - **Weaknesses:** Over-reliance on external energy sources can make the individual vulnerable in situations where power supplies are limited. Some experience degradation in **sensitivity to temperature**, leading to disorientation.
2. **Titanite Integration:**
    
    - **Effects:** Grants the individual **immense strength** and **density**, turning them into a walking juggernaut. They become highly resistant to kinetic damage and may develop the ability to **interact with reactive materials**, making them valuable for tasks requiring physical manipulation of volatile substances.
    - **Weaknesses:** Titanite integration often increases body mass significantly, which can make it difficult for the augmented to function in environments with low gravity or perform tasks requiring **agility**.
3. **Adamantian Integration:**
    
    - **Effects:** Bestows near-impenetrable **defense**, rendering the Nano-Augmented virtually indestructible. This makes them ideal for **high-risk combat roles** or **extreme environmental conditions** such as deep-space exploration. The individual may also gain enhanced **cutting abilities**, allowing them to slice through nearly any material.
    - **Weaknesses:** The increased hardness and rigidity can lead to a **loss of flexibility** or **mobility**. Individuals with Adamantian integration are often slower and less agile, making them more vulnerable to agile opponents.
4. **Palladian Integration:**
    
    - **Effects:** Allows for the manipulation of **biological and chemical systems**, granting the Nano-Augmented the ability to enhance or mutate organic material around them. This could involve **regenerative abilities**, accelerated **healing**, or controlling **biological toxins** for offensive purposes.
    - **Weaknesses:** Palladian's toxic nature can lead to **long-term health issues** for the augmented, including mental instability, paranoia, or even self-induced mutations if not carefully regulated.
5. **Cryozyme Integration (Not Recommended):**
    
    - **Effects:** Individuals integrated with Cryozyme develop powers of **cryokinesis**, allowing them to absorb and control **thermal energy**. They can freeze opponents or objects and are highly resistant to cold environments. Some can even convert the matter around them into more Cryozyme, though this process is dangerous.
    - **Weaknesses:** Cryozyme integration often leads to **insatiable hunger** for energy, causing the augmented to consume more energy than normal. This constant need for energy can drive the individual to madness, and the risk of **uncontrolled mutation** is ever-present.
6. **Zeronene Integration:**
    
    - **Effects:** Provides the ability to **manipulate gravity fields**, allowing for **flight**, **enhanced mobility**, or even creating localized **gravity wells** to crush enemies. This integration is highly coveted for individuals in deep-space roles or those specializing in experimental combat tactics.
    - **Weaknesses:** Zeronene integration can lead to **dizziness**, **spatial disorientation**, and in extreme cases, a gradual disconnect from planetary gravitational norms, making it difficult for the augmented to function on planets with regular gravity.

#### **Fuel Gas as Breathable Air for the Nano-Augmented**

Many heavily augmented individuals, especially those who have undergone **Material Integration**, no longer rely on **normal air** for survival. Instead, they breathe **Fuel Gas**, which powers their nanotech-enhanced systems and allows them to function at peak efficiency.

- **Fuel Gas Dependence:** Those who rely on Fuel Gas for respiration gain **constant access to energy**, which fuels their augmented abilities, including enhanced strength, speed, and cognitive function. These augmented individuals often work in environments rich in Fuel Gas, such as the **Gas Cities of Jupiter** and **Saturn**, where they thrive in conditions that would be toxic to non-augmented beings.
    
- **Performance Enhancement:** Breathing Fuel Gas provides augmented individuals with **improved stamina**, allowing them to operate without the need for food or rest for extended periods. However, this dependence comes with a downside—without access to Fuel Gas, these individuals experience severe **withdrawal symptoms**, including **weakness**, **shortness of breath**, and **paranoia**.
    
- **Addiction and Withdrawal:** Over time, augmented individuals who rely on Fuel Gas may become **addicted**, requiring larger and more frequent supplies to maintain their enhanced abilities. Withdrawal from Fuel Gas can be debilitating, leading to **physical and psychological symptoms** that weaken the augmented and make them vulnerable to attack.
