For the **New Earth Government (NEG)**, **Dragonwatch** is a critical city within its territory and a **sovereign part of New Earth** that ORDER occupies by mutual agreement. To the NEG, Dragonwatch is an essential urban area with a distinct culture and strategic importance, made more complex by ORDER’s presence in ORDER Tower. While the NEG acknowledges the role ORDER plays in defending New Earth, it believes Dragonwatch should be recognized as a **city of New Earth** first, with ORDER’s influence limited to ORDER Tower and minimal involvement in municipal affairs.

The NEG values Dragonwatch as a **cultural and economic center**, a site of pilgrimage, trade, and innovation that belongs to the people of New Earth. Although they maintain cooperation with ORDER to ensure peaceful coexistence, the NEG views ORDER’s influence as **excessive** and sees the joint governance structure as essential to keeping ORDER’s authority in check.

The NEG’s stance includes:

- Dragonwatch is a New Earth city, and ORDER should respect local governance, keeping its operations within ORDER Tower.
- Joint governance is necessary to balance ORDER’s influence and to ensure New Earth citizens remain central to Dragonwatch’s growth and identity.
- Dragonwatch should reflect New Earth’s cultural heritage, not just ORDER’s multiversal ambitions.
- The NEG’s presence in Dragonwatch reinforces New Earth’s sovereignty and the rights of its citizens within their own city.

**In summary,** the NEG views Dragonwatch as a New Earth city with a unique position, where ORDER’s involvement should be limited, and joint governance is essential to protect the interests and identity of New Earth’s citizens.
