# Beginning Play

By following the rules of the game, this rpg module should be playable without a game master. Having one is recommended though. If you have a game master, then only they should read the module. Otherwise, you should only read sections of the module as called for. Reading ahead causes spoilers.

Do note that having more players will not necessarily make the module easier, although the module is written with four players in mind. It is also absolutely possible to play alone.

All players should choose a character from the [Roster of Survivors](ZooomsRoster.md). Which survivor you choose will determine your starting conditions (location, inventory, etc).

A map of the station should be built using the map tiles provided with the module, by following the [map building guide](ZooomsMapBuildingGuide.md). If you do not have the map tiles (either because you lost them or I haven't actually made them yet), then do your best.
