The **Dominion of the Lotus Throne** stands as a vast, spiritually-driven regime that claims to embody unity and enlightenment. It is a delicate alliance of four powerful megacities, each rooted in the ancient traditions and cultures of the East. These megacities, though unified under the banner of the lotus, represent distinct cultural legacies, preserved by their ruling **Sovereign Administrators**. Each Administrator governs with near-absolute authority over their respective city, drawing upon a deep spiritual heritage and rigid hierarchies to enforce their will.

Despite their outward displays of harmony and spiritual unity, the Dominion is fractured by internal rivalries. The four Administrators‚Äîeach vying for control‚Äîmask their ambitions behind the regime‚Äôs facade of peace and purity. Together, they rule in a fragile balance, each competing to outshine the others while presenting a unified front to the outside world. The lotus, a symbol of purity and enlightenment, adorns the banners of the Dominion, though beneath its serene surface lies a fierce struggle for dominance.

# Contenders to the Throne

### Sovereign Administrator Tenshi Kiyomizu

**Megacity:** **Sora-no-Miyako** (City of the Sky)

*Inspired by the spiritual and imperial traditions of Japan.*

Tenshi Kiyomizu rules with divine authority, presenting herself as the living embodiment of the celestial order. From her high seat in **Sora-no-Miyako**, the gleaming city that pierces the heavens, Kiyomizu commands a strict spiritual hierarchy. Under her rule, devotion to the Lotus Throne is absolute, and any who question her divine mandate are swiftly silenced. Her vision is one of harmony through order, but beneath the serene exterior lies a relentless drive to bring all of the Dominion under her singular control.

### Sovereign Administrator Qian Zhenwu

**Megacity:** **Tianxian** (City of the Heavenly Immortals)

*Inspired by ancient Chinese dynasties and Confucian philosophy.*

Qian Zhenwu sits at the head of the ancient and revered **Tianxian**, a city built upon millennia of spiritual tradition and wisdom. He preaches the virtues of balance, harmony, and the enlightened path, drawing on the teachings of the ancients to enforce a strict moral code. Though he speaks of the purity of the lotus, his rule is deeply pragmatic, and he is not afraid to use the weight of his vast bureaucratic machine to suppress dissent and outmaneuver his rivals. Zhenwu views himself as the natural leader of the Dominion, destined to restore the fractured unity of the East.

### Sovereign Administrator S≈≠n Ji-Woon

**Megacity:** **Gyeongseong** (City of Eternal Stars)  

*Inspired by Korean dynasties and philosophical traditions like Neo-Confucianism.*

S≈≠n Ji-Woon, the cunning and charismatic ruler of **Gyeongseong**, styles himself as the ‚ÄúEternal Guide,‚Äù a title reflecting his vision of spiritual awakening for all who dwell in his city. He believes that true peace comes not from the imposition of rigid laws, but from the enlightened self-discipline of his people. In practice, however, Ji-Woon wields his spiritual authority with an iron grip, guiding his citizens with subtle manipulation. Ji-Woon sees the other Administrators as misguided obstacles on the path to true unity, and his ambition drives him to seek supremacy over the Dominion.

### Sovereign Administrator Lin Xuefeng

**Megacity:** **Baihu** (City of the White Tiger)

*Inspired by Taiwanese indigenous spiritual traditions mixed with Daoism.*

From the towering heights of **Baihu**, Sovereign Administrator Lin Xuefeng rules with the fierce spirit of the White Tiger, the sacred guardian of her city. Lin portrays herself as the defender of the pure and untamed spirit of the Lotus Throne, blending spiritual wisdom with the strength of a warrior. She teaches that enlightenment comes through both contemplation and action, and that the people must be ever-vigilant to protect the purity of the Dominion. Though she often appears as a protector, Lin is ruthless in her ambition and seeks to unite the Dominion under her uncompromising vision of spiritual and martial dominance.

### The Lotus Throne

At the heart of the Dominion‚Äôs spiritual and political mythology lies the **Lotus Throne**, a legendary relic said to have been crafted during the height of the Second Renaissance. According to ancient texts and enduring folklore, the Lotus Throne is no ordinary seat of power‚Äîit is believed to grant divine authority and unparalleled wisdom to whomever claims it. The legend goes even further, suggesting that anyone who sits upon the Lotus Throne will ascend to become the uncontested emperor of the world, wielding the power to unite not only the Dominion but all of Terra under their rule.

This myth of the Lotus Throne fuels the ambitions of the four **Sovereign Administrators**, each of whom secretly believes that finding this fabled relic is the key to their ultimate victory. Despite the endless wars of maneuvering and internal rivalries, none of the Administrators dare openly dismiss the existence of the Lotus Throne‚Äîdoing so would expose them to ridicule and potentially weaken their position. Thus, each Administrator maintains teams of scholars, spies, and treasure hunters dedicated to seeking out the Throne, scouring the far reaches of the Dominion for clues to its location. These expeditions are often veiled in secrecy, as none wish to reveal any progress‚Äîor lack thereof‚Äîto their rivals.

Yet, despite the grandiose tales of the Lotus Throne's power, no evidence has ever emerged to suggest its existence. In truth, the Throne is nothing more than a myth, a convenient fiction kept alive to distract the Administrators and their courts. The throne serves as both a symbol of unity and a tool of division‚Äîeach Administrator clings to the hope of one day finding it and seizing ultimate power, all while ensuring their rivals continue to waste resources on the same fruitless pursuit.

For the people of the Dominion, the Lotus Throne remains a symbol of spiritual purity and divine right. It is whispered about in reverent tones, invoked in rituals, and used as a means of reinforcing the authority of the ruling Administrators. To suggest that the Throne might not exist would be considered heresy, and so the myth is preserved as both a tool of control and a beacon of hope‚Äîhowever false‚Äîfor those who dream of a unified and peaceful Dominion.
