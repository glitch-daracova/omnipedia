Publicly, the family business is known as ORDER. What it's an acronym for is never said, or if it is said it isn't the same as what was said last time. The skyscraper in the middle of the industrial district is the ORDER Building. It's filled with labs, offices, residences for employees, and various businesses that ORDER technically doesn't own. The top floor is a massive suite where the family resides.
