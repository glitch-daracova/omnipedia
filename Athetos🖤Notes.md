Each of the gods Athetos possess a stone of power, the source of their incredible abilities. However, only a being of supreme spiritual and mental fortitude can survive the stresses of using such a powerful stone. Thus, the gods Athetos are undisputedly gods.

[ðŸ–¤LeroyTyrannus](ðŸ–¤LeroyTyrannus.md) began life thinking himself a mortal. He had a brief career of heroism, which left him unsatisfied. You see, as his foes became stronger, they became easier to defeat. Mages and beings of magical nature practically fell over themselves to bend to his will. It was too easy, he became bored of being a hero and decided on something greater. Over time, he gathered a party of friends and colleagues, those who were almost as special as he. Leroy saw it as his destiny to become the one true king of gods, and nothing could stand in his way. The old gods of Noct_yr would either bow to him, or die.

[ðŸ–¤NolanGrimm](ðŸ–¤NolanGrimm.md), Then a god of death and protector of travelers, was sick of playing second fiddle to an ungrateful sky god, sick of being betrayed, sick of being made a fool. He never liked the living, he granted safe passage to the next life because it was his job, a job the sky god thrust upon him. When opportunity to overthrow the sky god came in the form of Leroy Tyrannus, Nolan didn't hesitate. Now he is able to do what he truly desires, serving a god king who appreciates his work.

[ðŸ–¤MyraFortis](ðŸ–¤MyraFortis.md) followed Leroy because he always knew where a good fight could be found. One time, while travelling to other realms, Myra bumped into [PhobosðŸ”¶Wrath](PhobosðŸ”¶Wrath.md), daughter of God King Kaiser Phobos Lord of Fear in Aeth_yr. The two were equally matched, and their fight turned mountains into craters. The fight only ended due to the two of them being called away by their respective god kings for more strategically important battles.

[ðŸ–¤SolLuxor](ðŸ–¤SolLuxor.md) is reclusive, and doesn't speak of his past. One day, the sun stopped rising, it slipped back under the horizon and never returned. Were Sol a mortal, it might be reasonable to assume that he suffers from a form of depression and ptsd. However, he is a god, and is expected to be above such things. Since he won't talk about it, there's no way to know for sure.

[ðŸ–¤JimmyCeleritas](ðŸ–¤JimmyCeleritas.md), fastest speedster in the multiverse and sexiest god alive. While he's never lost a race, he has once engaged in a fight that was utterly humiliating. In the rival godly house Yakobe, there is a god of time known as [ðŸŸ£AzkaQuickshade](ðŸŸ£AzkaQuickshade.md). Speed is measured as distance / time. Azka controls time, and Jimmy stood no chance. He hates Azka for this cruel joke, and seeks his revenge upon her.

[ðŸ–¤IrisClementia](ðŸ–¤IrisClementia.md) is a pacifist, she'd rather forgive and forget. However, when she forgives, everyone forgets. That sky god I've mentioned a couple times now? There's a reason nobody remembers his name.

[ðŸ–¤MatthiasVoidheart](ðŸ–¤MatthiasVoidheart.md) could be considered a "bad egg". While Nolan could point to specific betrayals, Matthias saw every action as a slight against him. Among his current company, whom he barely tolerates, he almost admires Sol and his ability to just ignore everyone and everything. Unlike Sol, he will not ignore. Unlike Iris, he will not forgive. Perhaps when entropy is complete, then there will be peace.

[ðŸ–¤ZekeArcanix](ðŸ–¤ZekeArcanix.md) and his guild are responsible for the magical wards and defensive features (and offensive features) of Noct_yr. Wisdom itself is his domain. It could be said that his most ambitious experiment is ongoing: encouraging Leroy to become King of Gods and see where that goes.

#### Attributed to Philosopher Jeyne Argentius

Jeyne Argentius was a mortal scholar from **Noct_yr**, known for her exploration of the spiritual and psychological dimensions of existential dread. In her seminal work, _Shadows Within_, she delved into the idea that the void Matthias embodies is not a distant, abstract concept but an insidious presence within every being. This quote is perhaps her most famous:

> *"The void isn't 'out there.' Not beyond some wall or veil. No. The void is inside us. It's the hatred of others, anger at their joy, apathy at their suffering. That is the void, and it will consume you if you let it."*

Argentius believed that Matthiasâ€™s power over the void was a reflection of the darkness in the hearts of mortals and gods alike, a reminder that the true enemy often lies within.
