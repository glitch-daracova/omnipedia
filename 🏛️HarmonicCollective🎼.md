- **Architecture**: Structures in Harmonia are organic and fluid, with walls and floors that can change shape and color. Buildings often produce harmonious sounds when the wind blows through them, blending seamlessly with nature.

### Magical Paintings

#### Creation
- **Artistic Process**: Creating magical paintings requires immense skill and magical ability. The artist must pour their emotions and a part of their essence into the work, combining painting and spellcasting in a ritualistic manner.
- **Materials**: Special enchanted pigments and brushes are used, sourced from rare plants, minerals, or the essence of certain magical creatures. Each color and brushstroke carries specific magical properties.

#### Function
- **Activation**: These paintings can be activated by specific melodies or harmonies, often composed by the artist. Once activated, the painting shimmers and its colors become more vibrant, opening a portal to the depicted location.
- **Travel**: Stepping through the painting transports the jasling to the depicted location as if passing through a thin veil, with a brief sensation of passing through liquid light.

#### Locations
- **Other Worlds**: The paintings can lead to various locations within Harmonia or to entirely different universes, including serene landscapes, bustling cities, and uncharted realms.
- **Exploration and Discovery**: Jaslings use these paintings to explore, trade, and learn from other worlds, establishing connections and discovering new artistic techniques and magical practices.

#### Safeguards
- **Security Measures**: Paintings are protected by spells and wards, and only those with the proper musical key can activate them. High-value or dangerous portals are kept in secure locations.
- **Return Mechanism**: Paintings always have a counterpart in the destination, allowing jaslings to return home. These counterparts are often hidden or disguised.

#### Cultural Impact
- **Art Galleries**: Galleries in jasling cities are more than places to view art; they are hubs of travel and diplomacy, with curators maintaining the paintings and ensuring safe passage.
- **Festivals and Exhibitions**: Festivals celebrate new paintings, with grand unveilings where the artist and musicians perform to activate the portal for the first time, drawing large crowds.

#### Mystical Aspects
- **Living Paintings**: Some paintings are semi-sentient, reacting to the emotions of viewers or changing slightly over time. These living paintings might offer guidance or present new paths to explore.
