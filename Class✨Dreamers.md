Dreamers are people in the waking world who use a dreamcatcher "as intended".

## **Dreamers**

### **Overview**

A **Dreamer** is an individual who enters and navigates the dreamscape—a parallel, malleable realm that exists alongside the waking world. While the dreamscape is a place where reality can be bent or broken, Dreamers typically engage with it in a more passive and exploratory manner. Unlike Dreamrunners, who possess advanced skills and a deep understanding of the dreamscape's potential, Dreamers experience this realm primarily as a space for personal growth, adventure, and escapism.

### **Characteristics**

#### **Casual Participation**

Dreamers are generally casual participants in the dreamscape. For most, the dreamscape is akin to an immersive game or a vivid dream—an environment where they can explore, undertake quests, and interact with others without fully understanding or harnessing its deeper capabilities. Dreamers often see the dreamscape as a temporary escape from reality rather than a realm with significant consequences.

#### **Limited Awareness**

Most Dreamers possess a limited awareness of the dreamscape's true nature. They may recognize that the dreamscape allows for extraordinary experiences, but they do not typically comprehend its full scope or its connections to the waking world. As a result, their interactions with the dreamscape are often surface-level, driven by curiosity, entertainment, or a desire to explore different aspects of themselves.

#### **Reactive Experience**

Dreamers tend to have a reactive experience within the dreamscape. They follow paths laid out by the environment or by other entities, complete quests, and respond to events as they unfold. While they can make choices and take actions, they do not usually manipulate the dreamscape in significant ways. Their experiences are shaped more by the dreamscape itself than by their own willpower or intent.

#### **Personal Fulfillment**

For many Dreamers, the dreamscape serves as a space for personal fulfillment. It is a realm where they can confront their fears, live out fantasies, and experiment with different identities or abilities. While these experiences can lead to personal growth, they are typically contained within the dreamscape and do not have a lasting impact on the waking world.

#### **Connection to Reality**

Dreamers generally maintain a clear distinction between the dreamscape and reality. While they may enjoy their time in the dreamscape, they see it as a separate experience—something to be left behind when they wake up or return to their daily lives. The dreamscape, to them, is an entertaining diversion rather than a place of serious consequence.

### **Role in the Dreamscape**

#### **Explorers and Adventurers**

Dreamers are often explorers and adventurers within the dreamscape. They may seek out new locations, interact with other dreamers or dream entities, and take on quests that offer rewards or personal satisfaction. Their focus is on experiencing what the dreamscape has to offer rather than altering or controlling it.

#### **Social Interactions**

Many Dreamers use the dreamscape as a platform for social interaction. They meet with friends, join groups, or engage in cooperative activities. The dreamscape’s fluidity allows for a wide range of social experiences, from casual hangouts to group quests, fostering a sense of community among Dreamers.

#### **Temporary Inhabitants**

Dreamers are often seen as temporary inhabitants of the dreamscape. They enter and exit the realm as they please, without leaving a lasting mark. Their presence in the dreamscape is transient, and they do not typically seek to establish permanent influence or control over it.

### **Differences from Dreamrunners**

While Dreamers and Dreamrunners both operate within the dreamscape, they differ significantly in their approach, awareness, and impact:

- **Skill Level:** Dreamers lack the advanced skills and knowledge that define Dreamrunners. They do not typically manipulate the dreamscape or engage in high-stakes missions that have repercussions in the waking world.
    
- **Awareness:** Dreamers often see the dreamscape as a simple escape, whereas Dreamrunners understand its deeper connections to reality and its potential as a tool or battleground.
    
- **Impact:** The actions of Dreamers are generally contained within their own experiences, while Dreamrunners can influence the dreamscape and the waking world in significant ways.
    

### **Notable Dreamers**

While Dreamers are typically ordinary individuals, some have made a name for themselves through their adventures or unique interactions within the dreamscape. However, these figures often transition into becoming Dreamrunners as their skills and awareness grow.

### **Risks and Limitations**

#### **Surface-Level Engagement**

Dreamers often engage with the dreamscape at a surface level, which limits their ability to fully understand or harness its potential. This can leave them vulnerable to manipulation by more experienced entities or Dreamrunners.

#### **Dependence on the Dreamscape**

For some Dreamers, the dreamscape can become a crutch—a place where they retreat to avoid the challenges of the waking world. This overreliance on the dreamscape can lead to difficulties in maintaining a balanced life.

#### **Limited Influence**

Dreamers do not typically have a lasting influence on the dreamscape or the waking world. Their actions, while personally fulfilling, are often ephemeral and do not contribute to broader changes or events within the dreamscape.

### **Conclusion**

Dreamers play an essential role in the dreamscape as explorers, adventurers, and social participants. While they may not wield the same power or influence as Dreamrunners, they contribute to the vibrancy and diversity of the dreamscape. For most Dreamers, the dreamscape remains a place of wonder and personal discovery—a realm where the boundaries of reality can be stretched, if only for a while.
