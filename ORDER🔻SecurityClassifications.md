ORDER enforces a structured hierarchy of **security classifications** to control access to its vast facilities, sensitive information, and resources across the multiverse. These classifications ensure that personnel, visitors, and civilians interact with ORDER‚Äôs infrastructure in accordance with their roles and security clearances, maintaining ORDER‚Äôs standards of confidentiality and operational integrity.

---

#### Overseer/Director Only

- **Access Level:** Restricted to specific Overseers or Directors.
- **Description:** This top-level classification limits access exclusively to the assigned Overseer or Director responsible for the information or facility. Due to their higher rank, Overseers automatically have access to any Director-Only security level within their jurisdiction. This classification covers highly sensitive data, command rooms, and classified facilities, where even senior personnel require explicit permission to enter.

#### High Security (‚ÄúHi-Sec‚Äù)

- **Access Level:** Requires direct authorization from the appropriate Overseer or Director.
- **Description:** Hi-Sec areas are reserved for critical functions, restricted research, and high-stakes containment. Authorization from the overseeing authority is necessary, with access records logged and closely monitored. Hi-Sec access is often temporary, granted on a per-mission basis or for specific research needs, ensuring that only vetted personnel interact with ORDER‚Äôs most sensitive operations.

#### Medium Security (‚ÄúMid-Sec‚Äù)

- **Access Level:** Authorized personnel only, with possible Director notification or context-based requirements.
- **Description:** Mid-Sec areas are accessible to qualified personnel with sufficient clearance, although some contexts (such as specific hours, projects, or roles) may require notification of the facility Director. This classification covers areas like specialized laboratories, sections of the Endless Archive, and certain research and operational spaces. Mid-Sec is flexible but still maintains strict oversight and limited access based on operational needs.

#### Low Security (‚ÄúLo-Sec‚Äù)

- **Access Level:** Open to all ORDER personnel.
- **Description:** Lo-Sec areas include general operational zones, non-restricted archives, communal spaces, and residential quarters for ORDER personnel. These areas are accessible to all personnel without special clearance, although identification may be required for entry. Lo-Sec zones are designed to facilitate day-to-day work and offer general resources and amenities within the facility.

#### Zero Security (‚ÄúNull-Sec")

- **Access Level:** Open to civilians, with identification checkpoints as required.
- **Description:** Null-Sec zones are accessible to civilians and serve as ORDER‚Äôs public-facing areas. These zones often include visitor centers, designated Null-Sec areas within ORDER Tower, and other spaces for cultural exchange and recruitment. Null-Sec zones have entry and exit checkpoints to monitor civilian access and ensure security while promoting safe interaction between ORDER personnel and visitors from connected realms.

### Classification: Top Sneaky

> **Top Sneaky**
> *You are not authorized to read this section.*

**"Top Sneaky"** is an **unofficial classification** used by the **Shadesmith brothers** within ORDER, applied to their most closely guarded personal secrets. Known only to the brothers themselves and rarely shared outside their circle, Top Sneaky is a **mutual agreement of secrecy and respect** among the Shadesmiths, allowing them to conceal sensitive information, technologies, and details about each other‚Äôs lives or missions.

#### Purpose and Culture of Top Sneaky

The origin of the Top Sneaky classification reflects the brothers‚Äô recognition that ORDER itself holds many secrets. The organization‚Äôs general rule on classifications‚Äî**‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt know what a particular classification means, then you probably don‚Äôt have the clearance to find out‚Äù**‚Äîinspired the Shadesmiths to adopt their own code for maintaining personal privacy. In this way, the Top Sneaky label allows them to protect each other‚Äôs secrets in a manner that even surpasses ORDER‚Äôs standard protocols.

- **Mutual Agreement**: Each brother abides by an unspoken code to respect the others‚Äô boundaries. Top Sneaky provides them with a framework to safeguard sensitive details‚Äîbe it experimental technology, secret projects, or personal vulnerabilities‚Äîwithout interference or inquiry.
    
- **Penalties for Breach**: Violating a Top Sneaky classification has serious consequences, varying according to context. Minor breaches or accidental disclosures may result in amnestic treatment, erasing specific memories to preserve secrecy. In extreme cases, if a Top Sneaky secret poses a critical threat or is willfully compromised, the penalty may escalate to death, enforced as necessary by the brothers themselves or ORDER‚Äôs Overseers.
    

#### Examples of Top Sneaky Secrets

Some of the most critical secrets concealed under Top Sneaky include:

- **Shadesmith Cores**: The existence and modifications of each brother‚Äôs Shadesmith Core are universally classified as Top Sneaky. These cores, which store each brother‚Äôs consciousness, are concealed within their respective ships or locations, heavily protected from even ORDER‚Äôs highest clearance levels.
    
- **Personal Operations and Experiments**: Certain brothers, such as **Gabrael**, engage in secret projects, blending technology and magic or conducting experimental research that may have consequences beyond ORDER‚Äôs regulations. These projects are hidden under Top Sneaky to avoid outside interference or unwanted scrutiny.
    
- **Unique Abilities and Connections**: Specialized skills, like **Ikarus‚Äôs cryozyme manipulation** and **Alzael‚Äôs knowledge of arcane artifacts**, are Top Sneaky, protecting both their capabilities and vulnerabilities from discovery or exploitation.
    

#### Respect and Unity in Secrecy

Top Sneaky is more than a classification; it is a symbol of **trust and solidarity** within the Shadesmith Brotherhood. While ORDER enforces strict security protocols, the Top Sneaky code allows the brothers to protect each other‚Äôs autonomy, providing an added layer of security for their most personal and powerful secrets. Through this system, they are able to navigate both loyalty to ORDER and loyalty to each other, ensuring that their bond remains unbreakable, even within an organization defined by its secrets.
