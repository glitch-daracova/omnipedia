# üñ§ Matthias Voidheart, "The Dragonslayer"

- **Affiliation**: [üèõHouseAthetosüñ§](üèõHouseAthetosüñ§.md)
- **Stone**: Hematite
- **Power**: Void
- **Profile**: A dragon who loathes his own kind and nearly all others, Matthias is driven by hatred and emptiness. The void in his chest where his heart should be symbolizes his nihilistic existence and the destructive force he wields.

#### Origins: A Heart of Void

Matthias Voidheart is a being consumed by **hatred**‚Äînot for a specific enemy or a particular betrayal, but for existence itself. While others in **House Athetos** wield their power with purpose, Matthias embodies **nihilism**. His hatred is indiscriminate, his loathing profound. Once a dragon of unparalleled power, Matthias rejected his kind, viewing their arrogance and pride as a reflection of everything he despises about the multiverse.

- **The Dragonslayer**: Matthias earned his title by waging a one-man war against his own kin, systematically hunting and destroying dragons across realms. His actions were not born of vengeance but of disgust‚Äîa desire to extinguish their existence from the multiverse.
- **A Hollow Victory**: With the dragons nearly eradicated, Matthias found no satisfaction in his conquest. The void where his heart once was became a metaphorical truth: a **gaping emptiness** that no victory could fill.

#### A God Apart

Even among the gods of **House Athetos**, Matthias is an outsider. He barely tolerates their company, finding their ambitions and rivalries petty and meaningless. Yet, he remains a part of the House, drawn not by loyalty but by the shared understanding that **entropy is inevitable**.

- **Admiration for Sol**: Of all his peers, Matthias feels a reluctant kinship with **Sol Luxor**. He respects Sol‚Äôs ability to withdraw from the chaos of existence, seeing it as a form of quiet protest against the multiverse. However, Matthias lacks Sol‚Äôs patience‚Äîwhere Sol ignores, Matthias seeks to **obliterate**.
- **Antithesis to Iris**: Matthias holds **Iris Clementia** in contempt, viewing her forgiveness as weakness. To Matthias, nothing deserves absolution. Peace, to him, can only come when all things are consumed by the void.

#### The Void Within

Matthias‚Äôs power is as bleak and unyielding as his outlook. He wields the **stone of Hematite**, channeling the infinite emptiness of the void. His abilities are as destructive as they are symbolic, erasing matter, energy, and even light from existence.

- **Power of the Void**: Matthias can summon void tendrils to consume his enemies, leaving no trace behind. His presence alone drains warmth and vitality from the air, creating an aura of despair.
- **Entropy Incarnate**: He believes that all things inevitably decay into nothingness, and he sees himself as the harbinger of this universal truth. His actions are less about personal ambition and more about accelerating the natural collapse of the multiverse.

---

#### Strengths and Weaknesses

- **Strengths**: Matthias‚Äôs destructive power is unparalleled, making him a fearsome force on the battlefield. His detachment and cold logic allow him to remain focused even in the most chaotic situations.
- **Weaknesses**: His nihilism blinds him to opportunities for growth or unity. His disdain for others often leaves him isolated, making it difficult for him to form meaningful alliances.

#### The Endgame

Matthias‚Äôs ultimate goal is as bleak as his nature: **the complete dissolution of existence**. To him, peace can only be achieved when the multiverse has collapsed into entropy, and the endless cycle of creation and destruction has ceased. Unlike his peers, who seek power or purpose, Matthias finds solace in the thought of an **inevitable end**.

- **A Reluctant Ally**: While his goals align with **House Athetos** in the short term, Matthias‚Äôs ultimate vision places him at odds with the others. He serves the House not out of loyalty but out of convenience, using its resources to further his destructive agenda.
- **Unwavering Resolve**: Matthias will not forgive. He will not forget. To him, existence itself is a betrayal, and he will not rest until all things return to the void.

#### Legacy and Influence

Matthias Voidheart is a walking contradiction: a god driven by purpose, yet utterly purposeless. His hatred for existence makes him a **force of nature**, a being whose presence demands attention even as he seeks to erase everything around him. To the people of **Noct_yr**, he is a figure of dread and despair, a reminder that even gods can be consumed by emptiness.

Within **House Athetos**, Matthias is both an asset and a threat‚Äîa god whose destructive power serves their ambitions but whose nihilism could one day make him their undoing. For Matthias, none of this matters. Peace, to him, is not a state of harmony but the quiet stillness of a multiverse consumed by the void.
