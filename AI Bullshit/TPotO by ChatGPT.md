please write a version of the song "phantom of the opera" with the gender roles reversed.

(Verse 1) In sleep, she comes to me Unveiling love's serenade Her tender voice, a symphony, Echoing through the masquerade

A haunting soul, trapped and deprived, She yearns for freedom in her heart But destiny is yet to be revived, A tale where genders now take part

(Pre-Chorus) He's the phantom of my dreams, With passion deep within his eyes His presence whispers and redeems, An enigma I can't despise

(Chorus) Phantom of the opera, he calls my name Through shadows we dance, our hearts aflame In this twisted ballet that fate has choreographed, The roles reversed as our story unfolds unwrapped

(Verse 2) Behind the mask that shields his face, Lies a fragile soul longing for release. Yet society ridicules him with disgrace; Bound by expectations that never cease.

Within these hallowed halls so grand, He sings his songs of darkness and despair. A mesmerizing figure at command; Subjected to judgment; it's just not fair.

(Bridge) Oh, how they judge without knowing his truth! But I see beyond their shallow gaze. Together we'll defy this social noose; For love transcends societal ways.

(Chorus) Phantom of the opera, he calls my name Through shadows we dance, our hearts aflame In this twisted ballet that fate has choreographed The roles reversed as our story unfolds unwrapped

(Solo)

(Bridge) (x2)

(Outro) Our worlds entwined beneath chandeliers' light Breaking barriers with every note sung right Together we'll rise above their narrow minds  
In love's embrace forevermore entwined

(Verse 3) In the depths of darkness, we find solace, Two souls entangled in a forbidden dance. Defying norms with each tender embrace, Our love defies the boundaries of chance.

The stage is set, our destiny unfolds, A symphony of passion and desire. Through trials and tribulations untold, We'll face the world's judgment with hearts afire.

(Pre-Chorus) She's the phantom of my dreams, Her presence sets my spirit free. Together we'll rewrite society's schemes, Creating a world where love can truly be.

(Chorus) Phantom of the opera, she calls my name Through shadows we dance, our hearts aflame In this twisted ballet that fate has choreographed The roles reversed as our story unfolds unwrapped
