Many social media platforms now have a section for adding your preferred pronouns. While I think this is silly, I don't want to offend anyone to whom this actually matters. I'd like to invent a set of "pronouns" that portray me as a godly/divine being. People who know me will get the joke.

Creating a set of "pronouns" that reflect a humorous and divine aspect while not intending to offend can be a delicate task, but here's an inventive approach that respects the significance of pronouns for many individuals while allowing you to share your personality:

1. **Zeus/Zir (He/Him)** - Playing on the name of Zeus, the king of the gods in Greek mythology, to add a divine flair while keeping it recognizable. "Zeus" can be used in place of "he/him," and "Zir" for "his/him." For example, "Zeus lent zir lightning bolt to me."
    
2. **Div/Divs (They/Them)** - Short for "divine," this set is easy to use and understand, mirroring the structure of "they/them" but with a godly twist. It's neutral and carries a majestic aura. For example, "Div forgot divs sunglasses on Olympus."
    
3. **Maj/Majs (She/Her)** - A short form for "majestic" or "majesty," offering a regal and slightly divine connotation while maintaining the simplicity of "she/her" pronouns. For instance, "Maj left majs scepter in the realm."
    

When using these pronouns on social media, you might want to consider adding a small note or disclaimer in your bio explaining the humorous intent behind your choice, just to ensure clarity and maintain respect for everyone's preferences regarding pronouns. Remember, the goal is to share a bit of your personality and humor without inadvertently making light of the importance of pronouns to others.

I like Maj/Majs, and your suggestion about a disclaimer is a good idea.

I'm glad you liked the "Maj/Majs" idea! Adding a touch of humor and personality to your profile can be a great conversation starter, and the disclaimer will help ensure everyone understands your creative approach. If you need any more advice or creative ideas, feel free to ask!

Maj/Majs - short for 'majestic' - regal and divine - like 'he/him' or 'she/her' - "Maj rules majs kingdom."
