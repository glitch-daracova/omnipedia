**The Azurath** is **Alzael Shadesmith‚Äôs** personal frigate, a compact yet formidable vessel constructed with the design principles that guided the Afterlife series, albeit on a smaller scale. Equipped with advanced weaponry and defense systems, The Azurath serves as Alzael‚Äôs primary vessel for **diplomatic, reconnaissance, and covert operations** within ORDER, reflecting his unique role in the organization. With its specialized interior and high-powered capabilities, The Azurath is designed for self-sufficient, high-stakes missions across the multiverse.

#### **Size and Armament**

The Azurath is heavily armed for its class, providing both offensive and defensive capabilities while remaining agile and versatile enough to respond to changing mission demands.

- **Dorsal Relativistic Cannon (4‚Äù Caliber)**: The Azurath features a single 4-inch caliber **relativistic cannon** mounted on its dorsal side. Though smaller than the main guns on larger ORDER ships, this cannon can unleash significant kinetic force, effectively neutralizing medium-sized threats.
    
- **Point-Defense Turrets**: A pair of **point-defense turrets** on the port and starboard sides offers close-range defense against smaller, faster targets such as drones, missiles, and boarding craft.
    
- **Ventral Missile Pod**: The Azurath‚Äôs ventral missile pod provides additional offensive versatility, allowing for various payloads‚Äîincluding high-explosive, EMP, and arcane-tipped missiles‚Äîthat enable Alzael to adapt to diverse combat scenarios.
    

#### **Defensive Architecture**

Built for resilience and durability, The Azurath is engineered to withstand high-threat situations without the heavier armor used on larger vessels. Its design prioritizes mobility and strategic defense:

- **Kinetic Shielding**: The Azurath‚Äôs kinetic shields protect against both physical and energy-based attacks, making it well-suited for hostile environments and direct engagements.
    
- **Octium Hull**: Constructed from **indestructible Octium**, The Azurath‚Äôs hull provides an exceptional layer of defense, allowing it to maintain structural integrity even under heavy fire.
    

#### **Unique Interior Design and Hidden Compartments**

Departing from the typical layout for frigates, The Azurath sacrifices passenger and cargo space to accommodate **classified compartments** that house Alzael‚Äôs sensitive materials and personal tools. These hidden areas allow Alzael to secure valuable resources and specialized equipment for his unique missions.

- **Arcane Artifacts and Secure Vaults**: The ship is outfitted with multiple concealed vaults containing **arcane artifacts, intelligence documents, and specialized gear**. These vaults are accessible only to Alzael, guarded by encryption, cloaking, and intricate arcane locks.
    
- **Encrypted Communications Array**: The Azurath also houses a hidden **communications array**, allowing Alzael to communicate covertly with ORDER‚Äôs top command or specific operatives. This system is uniquely encrypted and integrated into the ship‚Äôs infrastructure to maintain operational secrecy.
    

#### **Crew and Operational Capacity**

Designed for autonomous operation when piloted by Alzael, The Azurath can function without additional crew members due to its integrated control interface. In standard use, however, it requires a full crew for optimal performance.

- **Optional Crew of 13**: While Alzael‚Äôs augmentations enable him to control the ship solo, a full crew of 13 is necessary if the ship is operated by another individual or team. These personnel handle navigation, weapons, and tactical systems in Alzael‚Äôs absence.
    
- **Passenger and Cargo Capacity**: The Azurath can accommodate up to 13 passengers and a limited amount of cargo, providing support for small teams or specialized missions, although the hidden compartments restrict overall cargo space.
    

#### **Classified: Top Sneaky ‚Äî Alzael‚Äôs Shadesmith Core**

At the heart of The Azurath lies **Alzael‚Äôs true essence**, secretly housed within a **7th Revision Shadesmith Core**. Under the classification **Top Sneaky**, this core represents one of ORDER‚Äôs most advanced technologies and is known only to a handful of trusted Overseers.

- **Core Functionality and Cyberdragon Philosophy**: This core embodies the **cyberdragon philosophy** that sees the mind as software and the body as a disposable vessel. Through the core, Alzael‚Äôs mind, consciousness, and "soul" are stored and protected, granting him the cognitive processing speed of an AI and allowing him to remotely control his physical form.
    
- **Remote-Controlled Body**: Alzael‚Äôs "body" is an avatar controlled remotely from within The Azurath. This arrangement enables him to project himself into dangerous situations without placing his true essence at risk, making his physical form replaceable should the need arise.
    
- **Secrecy and Security**: The core is heavily shielded within The Azurath, protected by arcane cloaking, kinetic defenses, and secure encryption. This setup ensures that Alzael‚Äôs essence remains hidden and secure, allowing him to operate with the confidence that his mind is safe from external threats.
    

#### **Legacy of Resilience and Mystery**

The Azurath is more than a ship; it is a sanctuary, archive, and lifeline that enables Alzael to execute his unique mission profile within ORDER. Combining high-tech weaponry, advanced defenses, and covert capabilities, The Azurath stands as an embodiment of Alzael‚Äôs complexity and dedication to ORDER‚Äôs mission. Through the protection of his Shadesmith Core, Alzael not only lives by the cyberdragon way but ensures that his legacy and secrets remain preserved within the hidden heart of The Azurath, a vessel unmatched in its layered purpose and strategic depth.
