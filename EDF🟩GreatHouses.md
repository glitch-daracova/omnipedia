# To Do

I am imagining that the Great Houses (possibly should be called something else, but it's the best I've got right now), as institutions, serve 2 major functions.

1) They're the beurocracy of the empire, responsible for managing the day to day affairs of the empire's many organizations and assets. Anything above local governance falls under the jurisdiction of imperial government, and thus the great houses. The great houses are technically a separate structure from the cult, but most if not all seats of power are filled by cult members.

2) Noble families are not great houses. In fact, members of a family are often split apart to different houses. This is to instill rivalry within families and loyalty to the empire instead. 

The Penultimate Lords are a council of 5, one for each house. The Octogrammic Knights technically answer to both the Archdemons and the Penultimate Lords. However, all 5 of these lords are members of the cult, and as such answer to the Archdemons. I imagine that the attitude of the knights is that the lords can piss off, but that may vary by individual.

I have yet to explore this idea in depth.
