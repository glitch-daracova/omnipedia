#### **Overview**

**Cryozyme** is an organic and **living nanomaterial** that feeds off all forms of **ambient energy**, including thermal and electrical sources, in order to convert ordinary matter into **more cryozyme**. It has the appearance of a **radioactive, slime-like mold**, and its rapid ability to **grow uncontrollably** makes it one of the most feared and dangerous nanomaterials in the galaxy.

While its ability to absorb energy and mutate biological matter offers tempting opportunities for **augmentation** and **energy harvesting**, Cryozyme's uncontrollable growth and inherent danger make it a major threat to any ecosystem or system that encounters it. Entire worlds have been lost to Cryozyme contamination, and safe disposal of this material is **exceedingly difficult**, with even extreme measures such as jettisoning into a star proving ineffective.

#### **Properties**

- **Energy Absorption:** Cryozyme consumes **ambient energy**, including heat and electricity, to fuel its growth and spread. As it feeds, Cryozyme converts nearby matter—organic or inorganic—into more of itself, making it a **self-replicating nanomaterial** that expands exponentially if not contained.
    
- **Mutation and Assimilation:** Cryozyme has the ability to cause **radical mutations** in biological organisms it comes into contact with, often leading to **uncontrollable physical changes** or even turning the infected into **living hosts** for further Cryozyme production. While it is possible to integrate Cryozyme into an augmented body, this process is highly dangerous and rarely results in a successful outcome.
    
- **Nanotech Resistance:** While resistant to many forms of **containment** and **destruction**, Cryozyme is not entirely immune to other nanomaterials, although few can fully withstand its **conversion capabilities**. Most forms of energy-based attacks only feed Cryozyme, making it even more powerful.

#### **Applications**

Despite its dangerous nature, Cryozyme can be harnessed for **specific purposes**, primarily in **biological augmentation** or **high-risk energy projects**. However, these applications come with significant risks, and the cost of failure is often catastrophic.

1. **Biological Augmentation:**
    
    - **Cryozyme Integration (Not Recommended):** Some augmented individuals attempt to integrate Cryozyme into their biology, gaining abilities such as **energy absorption**, **cryokinesis**, and enhanced **mutative properties**. However, the dangers of doing so are immense, with most experiments resulting in **insanity**, **uncontrollable physical mutations**, or death. Successful integrations lead to individuals with **superhuman strength** and **energy control**, but these augmentations come at the cost of severe **mental instability** and an insatiable hunger for more energy.
        
    - **Physical Mutation:** Organisms exposed to Cryozyme undergo **rapid and extreme mutation**, often growing new limbs or deformities. While some researchers have tried to harness this for **regenerative medicine**, most attempts result in uncontrollable growth and **grotesque outcomes**.
        
2. **Energy Harvesting:**
    
    - **High-Efficiency Energy Absorber:** Cryozyme’s ability to absorb energy makes it theoretically useful in **energy harvesting** systems, where it could be used to generate power from waste heat or radiation. However, its uncontrolled nature makes it a dangerous choice for any power system, as it will quickly convert any surrounding material into more Cryozyme if containment is breached.
3. **Hazardous Weaponization:**
    
    - **Biological Weapon:** In rare instances, Cryozyme has been considered for use in **biological warfare**, where it could be deployed to **consume and mutate** entire ecosystems or enemy armies. Its ability to rapidly spread and assimilate anything in its path makes it a terrifying potential weapon, though its uncontrollable nature also makes it too dangerous to use in most tactical scenarios.
        
    - **Star Consumption Risk:** One of the most severe risks associated with Cryozyme is that it is capable of **surviving in the heart of stars**, feeding off the immense thermal energy of the star itself. Jettisoning Cryozyme into a star does not destroy it—instead, Cryozyme begins slowly **eating the star**, with the potential to collapse it over **centuries**. For this reason, Cryozyme disposal is one of the most heavily regulated and feared challenges in the galaxy.

#### **Cultural Significance**

Cryozyme is a material of **dread and mystery** in many cultures. Its uncontrollable nature, its capacity for unchecked growth, and its **devouring hunger** make it a symbol of **consumption** and **self-destruction**. The fear of contamination is widespread, with entire societies having been lost to Cryozyme outbreaks, cementing it as a material tied to legends of **apocalypse**.

- **Symbol of Unchecked Greed:** In many cultures, Cryozyme is seen as a metaphor for **uncontrollable hunger**—both literal and figurative. Its endless consumption of energy and matter has led to it being used as a cautionary symbol in stories of **overreach** and **hubris**. Leaders or organizations that push too far in their desire for power are sometimes compared to Cryozyme, with the implication that their **insatiable ambition** will eventually destroy them.
    
- **Object of Forbidden Knowledge:** Cryozyme is seen as a material that should be left untouched, and the **mad scientists** or **rogue researchers** who attempt to study or utilize it are often viewed as dangerously reckless. In many regions, possession of Cryozyme is not just illegal but is seen as an act of **moral transgression**, with those who handle it shunned or exiled for endangering all of existence.

#### **Production and Refinement**

**Growth and Containment:** Cryozyme is not **mined** or **produced** in a conventional sense—it is a **living material** that must be carefully harvested from **contaminated areas** or from failed **experimental facilities**. Any attempt to harvest Cryozyme must include **extreme containment measures** to prevent the material from spreading, as even a single breach could result in the loss of an entire facility.

**Containment and Disposal:** **Slag**, an inert material resistant to both **Palladian** and **Hyperium**, is one of the few substances known to withstand Cryozyme’s **conversion abilities**. Cryozyme is often stored in **slag-lined containers**, though the threat of eventual containment failure remains ever-present. **Disposal** is exceedingly difficult; simply burning it with **Breachfire**—a fire made of breach energy—has been attempted, but results are not publicly disclosed, as no one wants to admit failure in controlling Cryozyme.

**Secret Methods:** Certain agencies, such as **ORDER**, are believed to have developed **classified containment procedures** for Cryozyme, though these methods are not made available to the public. Some rumors suggest that Cryozyme is kept in **quarantine zones** deep within **uninhabited systems**, where its growth can be studied from a distance without risking galactic contamination.

#### **Economic Impact**

Cryozyme’s extreme danger and the massive risks associated with its use keep it outside the realm of **traditional economic markets**. Its trade is banned in nearly every civilized society, and it is only handled by **black market dealers**, **rogue scientists**, or **military black ops** organizations that are willing to risk catastrophe for potential gain.

- **Black Market Demand:** Despite its dangers, there is a significant **black market demand** for Cryozyme, particularly among those seeking **unconventional weapons**, **dangerous augmentation**, or **experimental energy sources**. However, the high price of containment failure means that Cryozyme is rarely traded and often treated as a **last resort**.
    
- **Catastrophic Cost:** The **cost of a Cryozyme outbreak** is immeasurable, with entire colonies and planets falling to Cryozyme contamination. As a result, governments and corporate interests pour vast sums into **containment technologies** and **emergency response teams** capable of addressing Cryozyme breaches.
