Within the fiction of the setting, there is a game people like to play. Chaos Arena's default mode is a 5v5 objective focused game with a heavy focus on both pvp and pve on a huge map, and also contains persistent rpg elements.

After a few rounds, each member of the Shadesmith family were asked to give their opinions.

**Hadrael** "I'm always the top scoring player in the match. If anyone on my team was half as good as me, maybe we'd win occasionally."

**Alzael** "It's an objective based game, individual scores don't matter. Play the fucking objective, you fucks."

**Gabrael** "Preparation is the key. With my superior equipment, I've already won before the match even starts."

**Michael** "My unbeatable tactical genius allows my team to achieve victory over technically superior foes. It's a shame that technically superior foes don't exist."

**Seth** "I'm the only player on my team and I'm still kicking your collective asses."

**Everyone** "Shut up Seth."
