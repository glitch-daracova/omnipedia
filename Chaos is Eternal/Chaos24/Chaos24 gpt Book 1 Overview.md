I am introduced as a dreamer. Within the dreamscape I am a swordsman and sorcerer, doing quests for whomever grants interesting rewards.

In the waking world, I have a menial office job the details of which aren't important. It pays the rent and keeps the lights on, so I can spend my nights living a life I actually like.

Much of the book will be filled with a few "baddie of the week" style stories, where I do a quest in the dreamscape.

The main plotline, however, involves one Sala Otanashi, and her ongoing vendetta against the mega-corporations. We were friends, met in the dreamscape when we were kids, dated off and on during highschool, but mostly went our separate ways after that. I assumed she had lost interested in dream games.

Sala had become a dreamrunner. And now, she was offering to teach me, if I helped her with a project of hers. That sounded like a quest to me, with interesting rewards.

So I became a dreamrunner myself.

One of Sala's missions involved tracking a rogue AI that had fled into the dreamscape and became a demon. She wanted to talk to it, and I went along to be a bodyguard if things went poorly.

Sala connected me to some of her contacts in my city. As a fledgling dreamrunner, I could do some work for them. It paid better than my day job, a lot better. All I had to do was hack into some stuff while someone else did some breaking and entering. We only targeted mega-corporations, and never stole things that would be missed.

The final mission of the book sees me operating in the real world, something I was very unaccustomed to. Sala would be my support, like I had supported others recently. I would enter a Binary Helix facility, and rescue Sala's sister, Diva. Thus, why it had to be me: I was the only one Sala knew who she trusted and knew what she looked like.

Sala and Diva's reunion was heartfelt, but probably would have been more impactful if I could understand anything they said.

The book will conclude with me attempting to go back to my regular dreamscape questing. I soon reawaken, finding myself not at home but in space. I had been abducted by aliens.

I am Glitch Daracova, main protagonist and author-insert character. I was born on Terra, August 29, 19987NA. The following is an overview of my origin story, a book I'll probably never write.

I am introduced as a dreamer. Within the Dreamscape, I am a swordsman and sorcerer, taking on quests for those who offer interesting rewards.

In the waking world, I work a menial office job, the details of which are unimportant. It pays the rent and keeps the lights on, allowing me to spend my nights living a life I actually enjoy.

Much of the book is filled with a few "baddie of the week" style stories, where I complete quests in the Dreamscape. These episodic adventures highlight my skills and the diverse realms I explore, offering readers a taste of the fantastical world I navigate.

The main plotline, however, centers around one Sala Otanashi and her ongoing vendetta against the mega-corporations. Sala and I were friends who met in the Dreamscape as kids. We dated off and on during high school but mostly went our separate ways afterward. I assumed she had lost interest in dream games.

Unbeknownst to me, Sala had become a dreamrunner. Now, she offers to teach me, if I help her with a project of hers. This proposition sounds like an enticing quest with interesting rewards.

Thus, I become a dreamrunner myself.

One of Sala's missions involves tracking a rogue AI that fled into the Dreamscape and became a demon. Sala wants to communicate with it, and I go along as her bodyguard in case things go awry.

Sala connects me with some of her contacts in my city. As a fledgling dreamrunner, I start doing work for them. It pays significantly better than my day job. All I have to do is hack into systems while others handle the physical infiltration. We only target mega-corporations and never steal anything that would be missed.

The book's climax sees me operating in the real world, an environment I am unaccustomed to doing such things in. Sala provides support, as I have recently done for others. I infiltrate a Binary Helix facility to rescue Sala's sister, Diva. The mission requires my unique skills because I am the only one Sala knows and trusts who can recognize Diva.

Sala and Diva's reunion is heartfelt, though it would have been more impactful if I could understand anything they said.

The book concludes with me attempting to return to my regular Dreamscape questing. However, I soon reawaken to find myself not at home but in space, abducted by aliens.
