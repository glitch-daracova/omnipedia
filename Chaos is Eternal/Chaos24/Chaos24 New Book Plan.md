# The New Book Plan
Chaos is a LitRPG set in a distant future.

## What is a LitRPG?
A LitRPG is a method of storytelling where events occur following a set of rules similar to a tabletop RPG. Characters have stats, attributes, classes, and all those things matter. There isn't enough of a ruleset to actually play Chaos as a game, but it will provide a framework for stories to unfold.

## What happened to the card game idea?
No longer happening, at least not with the current version of the project. I might return to it as a standalone project, but I promise nothing.

## Where and when does Chaos take place?
This setting spans the entire Milky Way galaxy. In relation to our current Earth timeline, nobody knows what year it is. Disk1 of our story will occur early in the second century of the new age, and mostly on Terra.
