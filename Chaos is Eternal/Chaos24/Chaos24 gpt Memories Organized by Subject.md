### **Dreamscape and Realms**

- **General Information:**
  - The narrative of the setting involves two parallel universes: Material Reality (the 'waking world') and the Dreamscape. Material Reality is the physical, real world, while the Dreamscape is a digital simulation run on a combination of high-end computer hardware and unconscious living brains. Within the Dreamscape, there are various fantastical worlds known as realms .

- **Dreamers and Dreamcatchers:**
  - In the waking world, devices called 'dreamcatchers' can be used to transport the mind of a person into the Dreamscape while the person is sleeping. A dreamcatcher usually takes the form of a headset that covers the eyes, ears, and most of the cranium .
  - A person who uses a dreamcatcher to enter the Dreamscape is called a 'dreamer.' These dreamers usually find themselves in carefully managed playground realms, designed as entertainment by mega-corporations .

- **Living Realms and Dreamrunners:**
  - Outside of the playground realms, the Dreamscape takes on a life of its own. These 'living realms' contain wholly simulated civilizations. Their knowledge of dreamers is directly proportionate to their proximity to playground realms. As you approach the fringes, realms become more strange and alien .
  - Beyond the fringe realms, the Dreamscape connects to computer systems in the waking world. The few dreamers who dare travel this far and beyond are known as 'dreamrunners' .
  - Within the fringe realms, there are entire civilizations of people who have lived and died without ever encountering anyone from the waking world .

- **Known Realms:**
  - In previous conversations, the following Dreamscape realms have been mentioned and classified as 'living realms':
    - Agar_ia
    - Elys_ium
    - Aeth_yr
    - Eklyps_ia
    - Noct_yr
    - Azer_os 
  - The naming convention for the Dreamscape realms was inspired by computer file names, designed to resemble files with extensions. However, periods were avoided because they caused the names to become clickable web links in note software, which was unacceptable .
