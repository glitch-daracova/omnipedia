I am in the process of writing a summaries for a series of books I'll never write. In a previous conversation, you helped me create this:

Where: 🌎 Terra and the 🌌 Dreamscape
Who: 🔻 Glitch Daracova and 🧛‍♀️ Sala Otanashi
What: My origin story
Why: Because I'm an egocentric ass and of course the first book is about me

I am introduced as a dreamer. Within the dreamscape I am a swordsman and sorcerer, doing quests for whomever grants interesting rewards.

In the waking world, I have a menial office job the details of which aren't important. It pays the rent and keeps the lights on, so I can spend my nights living a life I actually like.

Much of the book will be filled with a few "baddie of the week" style stories, where I do a quest in the dreamscape.

The main plotline, however, involves one Sala Otanashi, and her ongoing vendetta against the mega-corporations. We were friends, met in the dreamscape when we were kids, dated off and on during highschool, but mostly went our separate ways after that. I assumed she had lost interested in dream games.

Sala had become a dreamrunner. And now, she was offering to teach me, if I helped her with a project of hers. That sounded like a quest to me, with interesting rewards.

So I became a dreamrunner myself.

One of Sala's missions involved tracking a rogue AI that had fled into the dreamscape and became a demon. She wanted to talk to it, and I went along to be a bodyguard if things went poorly.

Sala connected me to some of her contacts in my city. As a fledgling dreamrunner, I could do some work for them. It paid better than my day job, a lot better. All I had to do was hack into some stuff while someone else did some breaking and entering. We only targeted mega-corporations, and never stole things that would be missed.

The final mission of the book sees me operating in the real world, something I was very unaccustomed to. Sala would be my support, like I had supported others recently. I would enter a Binary Helix facility, and rescue Sala's sister, Diva. Thus, why it had to be me: I was the only one Sala knew who she trusted and knew what she looked like.

Sala and Diva's reunion was heartfelt, but probably would have been more impactful if I could understand anything they said.

The book will conclude with me attempting to go back to my regular dreamscape questing. I soon reawaken, finding myself not at home but in space. I had been abducted by aliens.

The following is a first draft. It has many problems, such as partway through it starts treating Glitch in the first person, whereas it should have been first person the whole thing. Can you re-write this so that it matches the stylings of the previous book summary I shared earlier?

Our main protagonist and author insert character [[🔻 Glitch Daracova]] wakes up on board an alien ship many light years away from home. It's been weeks, and what little he remembers makes him glad he doesn't remember the rest of it.

Glitch and about 12 others are the survivors of a series of experiments to see just what happens when an anomalous artifact is exposed to humans. [[🔷 Corti]] are ruthlessly efficient, and completely uncaring for their test subjects.

The ship is attacked, and a psychic voice directs Glitch and the others to escape.

Turns out, the psychic voice was actually a super advanced AI named Prism, and she communicated to the humans through their newly acquired nano-augmentations. What nano-augmentations you ask? Well, the ones that have been growing in you for the past two months as a result of the experiments you survived, of course!

The book proceeds with Glitch going on a training montage with the group who rescued him. Glitch already was a fighter, but now he's a soldier. Well, sort of. Thing is, Glitch never realized that all of this was real, and not in the dreamscape. There was no taking it seriously, it was just a game.

Then came the big plan to destroy a Vexian super-weapon. A laser cannon that could blow up planets. Oops, did space mom forget to mention that the gun was mounted on a moon sized space station? Did she also neglect to mention that you're not just blowing up the gun, but also the entire station? Yes to both questions.

Big "Are we the baddies?" energy.

Oops, I'm a war criminal now. Civilian casualties: lots. Also dead. I'm totally dead.

Where: 🚀 Alien Spacecraft and 🪐 Distant Planets  
Who: 🔻 Glitch Daracova and 👽 Corti  
What: The harrowing survival and transformation  
Why: To uncover the unknown and face new challenges  

Glitch Daracova wakes up on board an alien ship, many light years away from home. Weeks have passed, and what little he remembers makes him glad he doesn't recall the rest. He and about twelve others are the survivors of a series of ruthless experiments by the Corti, who aimed to discover the effects of an anomalous artifact on humans.

During a sudden attack on the ship, a psychic voice directs Glitch and the others to escape. This voice belongs to Prism, a super-advanced AI communicating through their newly acquired nano-augmentations—augmentations that have been growing within them as a result of the experiments.

Rescued by a group of rebels, Glitch undergoes rigorous training. Already a fighter, he now learns to become a soldier. However, he struggles to grasp the reality of his situation, believing it all to be just another game in the dreamscape.

The main plot revolves around a daring mission to destroy a Vexian super-weapon, a laser cannon capable of blowing up planets. To his shock, Glitch learns that the cannon is mounted on a moon-sized space station. The mission isn't just to destroy the gun but to obliterate the entire station. This revelation brings a haunting realization: "Are we the baddies?"

The mission is a success, but it comes at a terrible cost. Civilian casualties are high, and Glitch finds himself labeled a war criminal. In the chaos, he is gravely injured, leaving him to confront the brutal reality of his actions and their consequences.

At the last possible moment, it occurs to me: "Are we the baddies?" After all, this was a research station, not just a military one. Not everyone on board was a combatant.

The mission is a success, but comes at a terrible cost. Civilian casualties are high, and I'm a war criminal now. I am also dead, which prevents me from confronting the brutal reality of my actions and the consequences of.

(a note for GPT, obviously I'm not actually dead, as I am able to provide this input. The POV character is also obviously not dead, as they are telling this short version of the story. Glitch is "dead" at the end of this book, but clever readers will notice that it can't be true for the reasons already stated. The aftermath will be explored in book 3)

What are some points that I should expand more on? This should remain only an overview though, I'm not actually writing the book yet.

## ASSISTANT
![[AI.webp|100]] <br> **ChatGPT**

Here are a few points you could expand on to enhance the overview without going into too much detail:

1. **The Experiments:**
   - Briefly describe the nature of the experiments conducted by the Corti scientists. What were their methods, and how did these experiments impact Glitch and the other survivors?

2. **Prism's Role:**
   - Expand on how Prism communicates with the survivors through their nano-augmentations. What are some specific instances where Prism's guidance was crucial?

3. **The Xaran Alliance:**
   - Give a little more background on the Xaran Alliance. What motivates them to fight the Vexian Empire, and what are some of their core values or beliefs?

4. **Draco Knightslayer:**
   - Describe Draco Knightslayer's personality and training methods. How does he transform Glitch from a fighter into a soldier? Include a few key moments from their training sessions.

5. **The Mission to Destroy the Super-Weapon:**
   - Elaborate on the planning and execution of the mission. What challenges do they face along the way, and how do they overcome them?

6. **The Moral Dilemma:**
   - Deepen the exploration of Glitch's realization about the civilians on the space station. What specific events or observations lead him to question the morality of their mission?

By expanding on these points, you can provide a more comprehensive overview while keeping it concise.

The third book in the saga of our favorite main protagonist and author insert character [[🔻 Glitch Daracova]].

I am dead. I blew up a space station legally distinct from a death star while I was in it. I am dead.

So why is this monologue still going?

I think, therefore I am.

I live.

My allies, the Xarans, they seem surprised to see me. We won, while I was busy respawning. In the meantime, they also found my homeworld, Terra. How convenient. It's good to be home.

It's good to be home.

Nothing matters.

None of this matters.

It's hard to slide back into my old life. My apartment has other people living in it. My job fired me. All my stuff is gone. My bank accounts are closed. I am dead, but I live. So I get back in contact with Sala's fixer friends, but I'm more of a hands-on kinda guy now. A killer for hire, a soldier of fortune.

Nothing matters.

With my new abilities, I don't need a dreamcatcher to jack into the dreamscape. At least there, all my old stuff is where I expect it, even my alternate accounts. I start being able to do some dreamrunning while awake. I call it "daydreaming". I get good at it.

The book then switches back and forth between my waking life and my several dream personas. Eventually, I reunite with Sala. We have a romantic sub-plot. I let her turn my main dream account into a vampire chevalier. Why not? None of this matters.

What I didn't realize was that as Sala's chevalier, I was bound to do as she willed.

She demanded I tell her what the fuck was wrong with me.

I told her everything that happened in book 2.

"Of course nothing matters!" she said "That's the point. You have to decide for yourself what's important to you, and never compromise on that."

I don't know if I actually believed her, or if being her chevalier made me believe. 

Either way, it worked. Gotta walk through the fire for what's important.

I give the fixers new instructions about what kind of jobs I'm willing to take. If we have to hurt people, it has to be bad people. Collateral damage is no longer ok. Whatever we steal, it goes to a good cause. Stuff like that. I had to explain what "collateral damage" is. Half my fixers stopped dealing with me. Some of them went so far as to put bounties on my head, they don't work as fixers anymore.

Whole world's watching every move. Maybe not the whole world, but it certainly felt like it with Regional Military Police bearing down from every angle. I had already died before, that didn't stick so the idea didn't scare me. They could put me away for a very long time if they were able to actually catch me though, that was a legit concern.

I don't really have plans yet for the rest of the book's plot, but there are some key events that must happen:

I lose control of my alternate dreamscape accounts. Over time, they had started becoming autonomous, doing things on their own while my attention was elsewhere. They develop personalities based on the skillsets I developed for them, and take on their own names. Eventually, I'm locked out of those accounts entirely, as they become wholly independent people. This takes place over multiple years, and occurs simultaneously with other events.

Near the end of the book, I am confronted in the waking world by a man wearing my face and speaking with my voice. He calls himself Seth, and he swears unholy vengeance by way of destroying everything and everyone I've ever loved. A bit dramatic. The ensuing conflict is the main plot of book 4, and we'll get into that later.

What can you tell me about my story so far?

## ASSISTANT
![[AI.webp|100]] <br> **ChatGPT**

Your story so far is a fascinating blend of sci-fi, fantasy, and psychological exploration. Here are some key aspects:

### **Overall Plot:**
1. **Book 1: Origins and Dreamrunning**
   - **Setting:** Terra and the Dreamscape.
   - **Protagonist:** Glitch Daracova, a dreamer and office worker.
   - **Plot:** Glitch leads a dual life, doing quests in the dreamscape while maintaining a mundane day job. He reconnects with his old friend Sala Otanashi, who introduces him to dreamrunning. They team up to track a rogue AI, leading to Glitch’s transformation into a dreamrunner. The climax involves a daring mission to rescue Sala’s sister from a mega-corporation.

2. **Book 2: Space Survival and Transformation**
   - **Setting:** Alien spacecraft and distant planets.
   - **Protagonist:** Glitch Daracova, with new allies.
   - **Plot:** Glitch survives brutal experiments by the Corti, gains nano-augmentations, and escapes with the help of an advanced AI named Prism. He joins the Xaran Alliance, undergoes rigorous training, and takes part in a mission to destroy a Vexian super-weapon. Despite the victory, he becomes a war criminal and is presumed dead.

3. **Book 3: Resurrection and Rediscovery**
   - **Setting:** Terra and the Dreamscape.
   - **Protagonist:** Glitch Daracova, grappling with his resurrection.
   - **Plot:** Glitch returns home to find his old life in ruins. He becomes a soldier of fortune, reconnects with Sala, and starts "daydreaming"—using his dreamrunning abilities in the waking world. The story explores his struggle with nihilism and his eventual realization of what truly matters, thanks to Sala. Glitch loses control of his alternate dreamscape accounts, which gain autonomy. The book ends with the introduction of Seth, a mysterious antagonist.

### **Themes:**
1. **Identity and Transformation:**
   - Glitch’s journey is marked by constant transformation—first as a dreamrunner, then as a soldier, and finally grappling with his sense of self after resurrection.

2. **Reality vs. Illusion:**
   - The blurred lines between the dreamscape and waking world highlight themes of reality and illusion, questioning what is real and what is a construct of the mind.

How would I better write the overview for book 3?

## ASSISTANT
![[AI.webp|100]] <br> **ChatGPT**

Here’s a refined version of the overview for Book 3 that matches the style and tone of the previous books:

---

**Where:** 🌍 Terra and 🌌 The Dreamscape  
**Who:** [[🔻 Glitch Daracova]], the [[🏛 Xaran Alliance 🔺]], and the [[🏛 Vexian Empire 🔷]]  
**Who Else:** [[🧛‍♀️ Sala Otanashi]], [[🔺 Draco Knightslayer]], [[🔺 Prism]], and many more  
**What:** The struggle to find purpose after resurrection  
**Why:** To rediscover what truly matters and confront new threats  
**Actually Why:** I'm still here, so why not?

---

I wake up on Terra, far from the alien ship where I supposedly died. Weeks have passed since I blew up a space station legally distinct from a Death Star. I am dead. So why am I still here? I think, therefore I am. I live.

My allies, the Xarans, seem surprised to see me. We won the war while I was busy "respawning." Conveniently, they also found my homeworld, Terra. It's good to be home, but nothing feels right.

It's hard to slide back into my old life. My apartment has new tenants. My job fired me. All my stuff is gone. My bank accounts are closed. I am dead, but I live. So I get back in touch with Sala's fixer friends, but now I'm more hands-on. A killer for hire, a soldier of fortune. Nothing matters.

With my new abilities, I no longer need a dreamcatcher to jack into the dreamscape. At least there, all my old stuff is where I left it, even my alternate accounts. I start doing some dreamrunning while awake. I call it "daydreaming," and I get good at it.

The story alternates between my waking life and my dream personas. Eventually, I reunite with Sala, sparking a romantic subplot. I let her turn my main dream account into a vampire chevalier. Why not? None of this matters. What I didn't realize was that as Sala's chevalier, I was bound to her will.

She demanded to know what was wrong with me, so I told her everything that happened in Book 2. "Of course nothing matters!" she said. "That's the point. You have to decide for yourself what's important and never compromise on that."

Whether I believed her or if being her chevalier made me believe, it worked. I had to walk through the fire for what’s important. I gave the fixers new instructions about the jobs I'd take: no collateral damage, only bad people get hurt, and whatever we steal goes to a good cause. Half my fixers dropped me. Some even put bounties on my head. They don’t work as fixers anymore.

The whole world's watching my every move. Maybe not the whole world, but it feels like it with the Regional Military Police closing in. I’ve died once, so that doesn’t scare me. But getting caught and put away for a long time? That’s a real concern.

While I don’t have the full plot yet, there are key events that must happen:

- **Loss of Control:** I lose control of my alternate dreamscape accounts. They start becoming autonomous, developing personalities based on their skillsets, and eventually, I get locked out entirely as they become independent entities. This spans over several years, occurring simultaneously with other events.

- **New Enemy:** Near the end of the book, I’m confronted in the waking world by a man with my face and voice. He calls himself Seth and vows to destroy everything and everyone I love. Dramatic, right? This conflict sets the stage for Book 4.

The Anomalous Artifact (which is getting tiring to type, so I'll shorten it to AA in my input) was designed by super-intelligences claiming to be gods that live in the dreamscape. Schematics for it were given to a Vexian prophet by said "gods". Building the AA required the use of a Universal Constructor, a machine also designed by "gods" and built by Corti engineers in the waking world.

the AA reacts to compatible biology by spawning nanites, which are able to live within and augment said compatible biology. Some humans (about 1 in 100), and rarely other sentient species (about 1 in 1000) are compatible.

Nanite augmentation, when the biology is compatible, is a seamless process. Nanites are not inherently intelligent, but the seem to "know" how to best keep their host alive. They are able to react to the mind of the host, although usually only on a subconscious level. If the host is a dreamer, then they will begin to manifest abilities and augmentations that are reminiscent of their dreamscape self.

Nanites will not inherently integrate with non-compatible biology. If nanites are forced into a host that is not compatible, they will behave like an aggressive auto-immune disease. Depending on the exposure, death may be slow and panful, or swift and painful.
