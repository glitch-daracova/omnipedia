In a tabletop rpg, set in a super-dystopian post-multiple-apocalyptic distant future where trillions of humans are crammed into continent-spanning megacities

The following will be a work of fiction, but for the sake of this exercise, I'd like you to pretend that the things I'm going to tell you are real.

Terra, third planet of Sol System and home of humanity, is a world ravaged by greed and disaster. But first, some history. The history of Terra is broken up into 3 main eras:

The Before Times contain all the history of our Earth, as well as an unspecified amount to time into the future.

The Age of Disaster is a period of time lasting between 1000 to 10000 years in which several apocalyptic crises happened, including an ecological collapse, zombie plague, and robot uprising. Despite this, humanity never stopped progressing, both in technology and in population count.

The New Age is the current time of the setting. Now, people of Terra live in megacities, colossal structures spanning hundreds of miles, built to protect humanity from the burning land and toxic air of the outside. Not that inside the megacities are safe either; gang violence, corporate exploitation and government corruption are but the more mundane hazards. The zombie plague was never truly solved, swarms of the undead are tracked and avoided much as we do today for bad weather. A vaccine exists, but is cripplingly expensive and only lasts a couple of years before another dose is needed. Furthermore, common objects can be "possessed" by malevolent AIs (commonly called "daemons"), and can act in unpredictable and often dangerous ways.

This has been a short overview of Terra, what do you think so far?

The New Age of Terra is measured from the year a man named Chad Thunder was (allegedly) democratically elected to be Sovereign Administrator. Who actually elected him is unknown, and what he is Sovereign Administrator of is a matter up for debate. However, under his authority, the American Megacities were united under a New America.

Within these megacities, there are groups who vie for control on a smaller scale. Regional Governors attempt to act on behalf of the Sovereign Administrator. Criminal gangs with their own dynasties operate in territories where law enforcement fear to tread. Corporations maintain their own private militaries to defend their facilities and perform operations against their rivals.

Not everything about life on Terra is awful. One respite available is the Dreamscape. Using a surprisingly affordable piece of machinery called a "dreamcatcher", a sleeping human can access a virtual dreamworld. The dreamscape can be described as a full-dive virtual-reality mmorpg, but this is only partially accurate. While most people will only ever see the carefully curated game part of the dreamscape, the outer fringes accessible to only the most dedicated of dreamers touches computer systems in the waking world. Those who dare explore these fringes are known as "dreamrunners", and may encounter corporate systems, or possibly AIs from the Age of Disaster.

The first book of my story will follow a character named Glitch Daracova, who was born in the Texas Megacity on august 29, 87na (for clarification, that's 87 years into the New Age). In his adult life, he works for Binary Helix as a code

Depict a dramatic scene on the beach of a deserted island where two powerful characters are meeting for a parlay, now with a twist in their themes. Alzael, originally an Angel of Order, is reimagined in a cyberpunk style. He has a futuristic look with neon elements, including cybernetic enhancements and a glowing plasma-sword. His attire includes a sleek, high-tech long coat with glowing accents.

Certainly! Here's a summary of the process and information used to create the images:

Character Descriptions: You provided detailed descriptions of two characters, Alzael and Myros, each with their unique attributes and backgrounds. Alzael was described as an Angel of Order with a pale complexion, long black hair, a distinctive white long coat, and a red plasma-sword. Myros was depicted as a formidable pirate lord with mastery of hydromancy, wearing a navy officer's coat and a large hat, symbolizing his authority and connection to the sea.

First Image Request: Based on these descriptions, you requested an image depicting a meeting between Alzael and Myros on a beach of a deserted island, for a parlay, with a fleet of ships at sea in the background. The scene was to be rendered in the style of 90s anime.

Second Image Request: After viewing the first image, you asked for another rendition of the scene but with thematic changes to the characters. Alzael was to be themed as more cyberpunk, featuring futuristic and neon elements, including cybernetic enhancements. Myros was to be reimagined in a more colonial era theme, wearing an elaborate navy officer's coat from the period, complete with ornate decorations.

Image Creation: Using your detailed descriptions and thematic requests, I generated two images using a text-to-image model. The first image captured the original anime-style meeting between Alzael and Myros. The second image introduced the thematic changes, showcasing Alzael with cyberpunk elements and Myros in a colonial era setting.

These steps led to the creation of two unique images, each reflecting the specific themes and character descriptions you provided.

please rewrite my initial character descriptions to better match the end result.

ChatGPT
Certainly! Here are revised character descriptions that align with the thematic elements of the final images:

Alzael is an Angel of Order. His skin harbors a pale, almost luminous quality, contrasting sharply with his long, black hair. His attire is a masterpiece of high-tech fashion, a sleek, white long coat adorned with mechanical devices. In his hand, he wields not just any sword, but a plasma-sword, its blade a vibrant red that cuts through the darkness with ease. Alzael is a vision of power and confidence, his presence a blend of ethereal grace and cutting-edge technology.

Myros: Myros, the dread pirate lord and master of the seas, carries the aura of a bygone era. His attire is a throwback to the colonial period, an elaborate navy officer's coat that speaks of his authority and deep connection to the sea. The coat, richly decorated and fitting of his status, is matched with a tricorn hat, adding to his imposing figure. His mastery of hydromancy remains undisputed, a testament to his ability to command the waves and lead his fleet with unparalleled prowess.
