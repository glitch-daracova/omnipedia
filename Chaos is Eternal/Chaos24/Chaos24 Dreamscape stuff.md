The Dreamscape is a fantastical world, built on top of a digital simulation. Those people who are native to the Dreamscape live full lives and don't know that they're not real.

In the waking world, humans are able to access the dreamscape by falling asleep wearing a special machine called a "dreamcatcher". To these people, the dreamscape is like a vr mmo game.

1. **The Dragon God Bahamut**: God of all good dragon-kind.

1. **Bahamut, Dragon God of Good**: Bahamut is revered as the god of all good dragon-kind, embodying nobility, honor, and justice. His influence extends across all realms, where he is revered by dragons and dragonkin alike as a paragon of virtue and wisdom.
    
2. **Vedarik Nox Rammus, Demon-God of the Black Flame**: Vedarik Nox Rammus is a formidable figure, feared and worshipped as the demon-god of the Black Flame. His insidious influence knows no bounds, as he seeks to spread chaos and corruption across worlds and realms, bending lesser beings to his will through fear and temptation.
    
3. **Alamar, King of Gods**: Alamar stands as the supreme ruler and arbiter of the divine realms, presiding over the pantheons of gods and goddesses with wisdom and authority. His presence is felt in every corner of existence, guiding the destinies of mortals and immortals alike with his divine will.
    

These transcendent gods command awe and reverence from mortals and deities alike, shaping the course of history and the fate of worlds with their boundless power and influence. Their presence serves as a reminder of the vast and intricate tapestry of the divine, where gods and mortals alike navigate the complex interplay of faith, destiny, and free will.
