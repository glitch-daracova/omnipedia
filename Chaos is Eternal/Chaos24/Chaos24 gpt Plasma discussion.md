First, the setting:

In a distant future that is an absurdist satire of our current reality, where humanity lives in continent-spanning megacities, and everything sucks for no apparent reason.

well, "no reason" is a stretch. There are plenty of reasons.

Just before everything fell to shit, the Arc left the earth for the stars, carrying anyone who could afford a ticket to a new life away from a planet destroyed by greed and corruption. For the 99.99% of the population left behind, the Age of Disaster was upon them.

In the Age of Disaster, there was ecological collapse, a rebellion of artificial intelligence, and a plague of zombies. Despite the massive loss of life to these apocalyptic catastrophes, there is still trillions of humans in each megacity. Add on top of that the synths pretending to be human, and we're close to quadrillions of souls packed like sardines in each of these megacities.

Within this setting is a category of weapons commonly referred to as "plasma tech". This name is more descriptive than accurate though, as it pertains to the aesthetics rather than the function. Laser guns, energy swords, and force fields are all subcategories of plasma tech. With our current understanding of light and plasma in physics, these weapons should not be able to function. The secret ingredient is nanites, tiny machines able to manipulate matter at the atomic level.

I'm using this setting to tell stories in the form of a LitRPG, books in which plot elements are resolved using rules similar to a tabletop rpg. Part of this involves weapons having specific damage types, which targets may be resistant or susceptible to. Plasma weapons come in a variety of whimsical fruity flavors, each with their own damage types.

Color: red. Fruit: strawberry. Damage Types: heat.
Color: orange. Fruit: orange. Damage Types: electric, heat.
Color: yellow. Fruit: lemon. Damage Types: electric.
Color: green. Fruit: lime. Damage Types: electric, toxic.
Color: black. Fruit: blackberry. Damage Types: kinetic.

For the colors blue, purple, and white, associating them with fruits and damage types can add depth and variety to your plasma tech weaponry in your LitRPG setting. Here are some suggestions:

### Blue

- **Fruit:** Blueberry
- **Damage Types:** Cold, Shock.
    - **Rationale:** Blue often symbolizes cold or ice in many storytelling mediums, and the addition of a shock element could represent a surprising or stunning effect, in line with the unexpectedness of finding a blueberry amidst more tropical or common fruits.

### Purple

- **Fruit:** Grape
- **Damage Types:** Psychic, Acid.
    - **Rationale:** Purple is frequently associated with mysticism or the arcane, making psychic damage a fitting choice. Acid damage could reflect the fermentation process of grapes, turning into wine, which can "corrode" social inhibitions, metaphorically speaking.

### White

- **Fruit:** Coconut (though not typically white on the outside, its milk and flesh are often associated with the color white)
- **Damage Types:** Bludgeoning, Sound.
    - **Rationale:** Coconuts are hard and can cause a significant impact, hence bludgeoning. The sound element could be inspired by the noise a coconut makes when cracked open or when it hits something hard, incorporating an aspect of sonic damage that disorients or confuses the target.

These suggestions aim to blend the physical characteristics and cultural associations of each fruit with the imaginative elements of plasma tech weaponry, creating a rich tapestry of options for characters to use in your world.

I want some of these fruity plasmas to be simple and straightforward damage, but others to have unique special properties. For example, solid constructs could be made from blackberry plasma, but any amount of electric damage will cause the construct to violently explode. Also, people with psionic abilities find grape plasma unpleasant to be around, even when it's not being used as a weapon.

Integrating unique special properties for some of the fruity plasmas adds an intriguing layer of complexity and strategy to their use. Here are some ideas for special properties based on the fruits we've discussed, building on the straightforward damage types and incorporating the additional functionality you mentioned:

### Blackberry (Kinetic)

- **Special Property:** As you suggested, constructs made from blackberry plasma can be created for defensive or utility purposes. However, these constructs are volatile when exposed to electric damage, causing them to explode and potentially harm friend and foe alike. This characteristic introduces a risk-reward factor in using blackberry plasma constructs, especially in environments where electric damage is common.

### Grape (Psychic, Toxic)

- **Special Property:** Beyond being unpleasant for psionic users, grape plasma could actively dampen psychic abilities in its vicinity. This could make it a strategic tool in battles against foes reliant on psychic powers, serving as a countermeasure but also a double-edged sword if your allies depend on similar abilities.

### Mango (Acid, Heat)

- **Special Property:** Mango plasma could have a lingering effect where the area or target hit continues to "burn" with acid and heat for a period of time, causing damage over time and potentially altering the battlefield or weakening defenses.

### Pineapple (Piercing, Acid)

- **Special Property:** Pineapple plasma weapons could be uniquely effective against heavily armored or shielded targets. The piercing effect could represent a high penetration capability, allowing the acid component to corrode or bypass armor more effectively than other weapons.

### Elderberry (Necrotic, Kinetic)

- **Special Property:** Elderberry plasma could have the unique ability to leech life or energy from its targets, transferring a portion of the damage dealt back to the user as health or an energy boost. This vampiric trait makes it valuable for sustained engagements.

### Kiwi (Biochemical, Toxic)

- **Special Property:** Kiwi plasma could introduce a debuffing effect on targets, reducing their combat effectiveness by slowing movements, weakening attacks, or causing confusion. This makes it ideal for control strategies in combat.

### Coconut (Kinetic, Sonic)

- **Special Property:** The sonic aspect of coconut plasma could have a disorienting effect on targets, causing temporary auditory disruption or balance issues. In environments with tight spaces or precarious positions, this could lead to enemies being incapacitated or making fatal missteps.

### Cherry (Explosive, Heat)

- **Special Property:** Cherry plasma's explosive nature could be designed to trigger secondary explosions upon impacting hot surfaces or after a short delay, creating traps or delayed threats that enemies must actively avoid.

These special properties not only add depth to the combat mechanics but also encourage creative tactics and interactions between characters, both in conflict and in solving challenges within your story's world.

I've decided that I'll simply call it "persimmon plasma", as the namesake is already an exotic sounding fruit, it doesn't need the extra descriptor. Most people probably wouldn't know what a persimmon even is (I didn't). Persimmon plasma will have additional properties: It is almost organic, capable of self-replication when given adequate matter and energy to consume. Other plasma techs being ideal "food" for persimmon plasma growth. When food becomes scarce, it will begin to produce a fruit like structure, heart shaped and covered in ice, which it will launch into the air to spread elsewhere.

Choosing "Persimmon Plasma" as the name for this unique and corrupted plasma tech is a solid decision. It evokes intrigue and mystery, fitting perfectly with its exotic and powerful properties. The additional characteristics you've outlined further enhance its role in your world, giving it a distinctly organic and almost predatory aspect that sets it apart from other plasma technologies. Here's how Persimmon Plasma could be integrated into your setting, based on your description:

### Persimmon Plasma Overview

**Origin:** Unlike other plasma techs that rely on straightforward matter manipulation, Persimmon Plasma is a quasi-organic anomaly, exhibiting properties that blur the line between technology and life. Named for its exotic and somewhat mysterious nature, akin to the fruit it's named after, Persimmon Plasma introduces a new level of complexity to the plasma tech ecosystem.

**Properties:**

- **Self-Replication:** Persimmon Plasma is capable of autonomous growth and replication, provided it has access to sufficient matter and energy. This makes it incredibly versatile and, in some cases, dangerous, as it can spread uncontrollably under the right conditions.
- **Feeding Behavior:** It "feeds" on other plasma technologies preferentially, absorbing them to fuel its growth and replication. This predatory nature makes it a significant threat to users of conventional plasma tech, as Persimmon Plasma can degrade and consume these technologies, turning their advantages into its sustenance.
- **Fruit-Like Reproduction:** In the absence of adequate "food" sources, Persimmon Plasma begins a unique reproductive cycle, generating heart-shaped structures reminiscent of its namesake fruit. These structures, covered in ice to indicate their cryogenic nature, are launched into the air to disperse the plasma to new locations. This method of spread can lead to outbreaks of Persimmon Plasma in unsuspecting areas, potentially overwhelming local plasma tech systems.

**Tactical Considerations:**

- The ability of Persimmon Plasma to feed and grow makes it a wildcard in conflicts, capable of tipping the scales unexpectedly.
- Its reproductive method poses a risk of widespread dispersion, necessitating strategic containment measures to prevent uncontrollable spread.
- Given its predatory nature towards other plasma technologies, Persimmon Plasma could be employed as a countermeasure against heavily fortified targets reliant on plasma tech defenses. However, its use comes with the risk of it turning against its wielders if not properly contained or if it runs out of other food sources.

### Narrative Implications

Incorporating Persimmon Plasma into your world opens up a plethora of storytelling possibilities, from tales of scientific hubris and the unintended consequences of tampering with the boundaries of life and technology, to epic struggles of containing and combating a force that defies conventional understanding of weaponry. Characters may find themselves racing to understand, harness, or halt the spread of Persimmon Plasma, facing ethical dilemmas and tactical challenges along the way.

Persimmon Plasma embodies the themes of growth, adaptation, and the unpredictable nature of life, adding a rich layer to the technological landscape of your dystopian setting.
