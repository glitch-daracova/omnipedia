I have here a collection of .md files, most of which are partial archives of past conversations. The overarching subject of which is a fictional setting for a LitRPG, for which myself and a few other authors are building a wiki of sorts.

The documents will be in a .zip file. Read "Chaos24 ðŸ€„ Home.md" first. Yes, there is an emoji in the file name.

Some documents will reference other documents. Links will appear in double brackets [like this](../../like-this.md). Be aware that not all documents referenced this way will be uploaded to you.

Some of the information in these documents are contradictory. Please be aware that the subject matter has evolved over time, and in most cases newer information should take priority over older information. However, some documents intentionally omit or simplify information to stay focused on certain subjects. Please be aware of such omissions and simplifications as you process these documents.

Please analyze these documents, I will give further instructions after.
