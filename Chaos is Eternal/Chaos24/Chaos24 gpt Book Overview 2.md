I am in the process of writing a summaries for a series of books I'll never write. In a previous conversation, you helped me create this: Where: 🌎 Terra and the 🌌 Dreamscape Who: 🔻 Glitch Daracova and 🧛‍♀️ Sala Otanashi What: My origin story Why: Because I'm an egocentric ass and of course the first book is about me I am introduced as a dreamer. Within the dreamscape I am a swordsman and sorcerer, doing quests for whomever grants interesting rewards. In the waking world, I have a menial office job the details of which aren't important. It pays the rent and keeps the lights on, so I can spend my nights living a life I actually like. Much of the book will be filled with a few "baddie of the week" style stories, where I do a quest in the dreamscape. The main plotline, however, involves one Sala Otanashi, and her ongoing vendetta against the mega-corporations. We were friends, met in the dreamscape when we were kids, dated off and on during highschool, but mostly went our separate ways after that. I assumed she had lost interested in dream games. Sala had become a dreamrunner. And now, she was offering to teach me, if I helped her with a project of hers. That sounded like a quest to me, with interesting rewards. So I became a dreamrunner myself. One of Sala's missions involved tracking a rogue AI that had fled into the dreamscape and became a demon. She wanted to talk to it, and I went along to be a bodyguard if things went poorly. Sala connected me to some of her contacts in my city. As a fledgling dreamrunner, I could do some work for them. It paid better than my day job, a lot better. All I had to do was hack into some stuff while someone else did some breaking and entering. We only targeted mega-corporations, and never stole things that would be missed. The final mission of the book sees me operating in the real world, something I was very unaccustomed to. Sala would be my support, like I had supported others recently. I would enter a Binary Helix facility, and rescue Sala's sister, Diva. Thus, why it had to be me: I was the only one Sala knew who she trusted and knew what she looked like. Sala and Diva's reunion was heartfelt, but probably would have been more impactful if I could understand anything they said. The book will conclude with me attempting to go back to my regular dreamscape questing. I soon reawaken, finding myself not at home but in space. I had been abducted by aliens.

The following is a first draft. It has many problems, such as partway through it starts treating Glitch in the first person, whereas it should have been first person the whole thing. Can you re-write this so that it matches the stylings of the previous book summary I shared earlier? Our main protagonist and author insert character [🔻 Glitch Daracova](../../-glitch-daracova.md) wakes up on board an alien ship many light years away from home. It's been weeks, and what little he remembers makes him glad he doesn't remember the rest of it. Glitch and about 12 others are the survivors of a series of experiments to see just what happens when an anomalous artifact is exposed to humans. [🔷 Corti](../../-corti.md) are ruthlessly efficient, and completely uncaring for their test subjects. The ship is attacked, and a psychic voice directs Glitch and the others to escape. Turns out, the psychic voice was actually a super advanced AI named Prism, and she communicated to the humans through their newly acquired nano-augmentations. What nano-augmentations you ask? Well, the ones that have been growing in you for the past two months as a result of the experiments you survived, of course! The book proceeds with Glitch going on a training montage with the group who rescued him. Glitch already was a fighter, but now he's a soldier. Well, sort of. Thing is, Glitch never realized that all of this was real, and not in the dreamscape. There was no taking it seriously, it was just a game. Then came the big plan to destroy a Vexian super-weapon. A laser cannon that could blow up planets. Oops, did space mom forget to mention that the gun was mounted on a moon sized space station? Did she also neglect to mention that you're not just blowing up the gun, but also the entire station? Yes to both questions. Big "Are we the baddies?" energy. Oops, I'm a war criminal now. Civilian casualties: lots. Also dead. I'm totally dead.

Where: 🚀 Alien Spacecraft and 🪐 Distant Planets  
Who: 🔻 Glitch Daracova and 👽 Corti  
What: The harrowing survival and transformation  
Why: To uncover the unknown and face new challenges

Glitch Daracova wakes up on board an alien ship, many light years away from home. Weeks have passed, and what little he remembers makes him glad he doesn't recall the rest. He and about twelve others are the survivors of a series of ruthless experiments by the Corti, who aimed to discover the effects of an anomalous artifact on humans.

During a sudden attack on the ship, a psychic voice directs Glitch and the others to escape. This voice belongs to Prism, a super-advanced AI communicating through their newly acquired nano-augmentations—augmentations that have been growing within them as a result of the experiments.

Rescued by a group of rebels, Glitch undergoes rigorous training. Already a fighter, he now learns to become a soldier. However, he struggles to grasp the reality of his situation, believing it all to be just another game in the dreamscape.

The main plot revolves around a daring mission to destroy a Vexian super-weapon, a laser cannon capable of blowing up planets. To his shock, Glitch learns that the cannon is mounted on a moon-sized space station. The mission isn't just to destroy the gun but to obliterate the entire station. This revelation brings a haunting realization: "Are we the baddies?"

The mission is a success, but it comes at a terrible cost. Civilian casualties are high, and Glitch finds himself labeled a war criminal. In the chaos, he is gravely injured, leaving him to confront the brutal reality of his actions and their consequences.

I wake up on board an alien ship, many light years away from home. Weeks have passed, and what little I remember makes me glad that I don't recall the rest. Myself, and about twelve others are the survivors of a series of ruthless experiments by [🔷 Corti| Corti scientists](../../-corti-corti-scientists.md), who aimed to discover the effects of humans to an anomalous artifact. That's right, they didn't care about us, they only cared about it.

During a sudden attack on the ship, a psychic voice directs us to escape. This voice belongs to [🔺 Prism | Prism](../../-prism--prism.md), a super-advanced AI able to communicate with us via our newly acquired nano-augmentations. These augmentations have been growing inside us as a result of the experiments.

We were rescued by a group of rebels. They called themselves the [🏛 Xaran Alliance 🔺| Xaran Alliance](../../-xaran-alliance--xaran-alliance.md), and [🔺 Prism | Prism](../../-prism--prism.md) is their leader. They're at war with the evil [🏛 Vexian Empire 🔷 | Vexian Empire](../../-vexian-empire---vexian-empire.md), and ask me to help. I undergo rigorous training at the hands of one [🔺 Draco Knightslayer | Draco Knightslayer](../../-draco-knightslayer--draco-knightslayer.md). I was already a fighter, but he turned me into a soldier. I went with it, of course. I believed it was all just another game in the [🌌 Dreamscape | dreamscape](../../-dreamscape--dreamscape.md).

The main plot revolves around a daring mission to destroy a Vexian super-weapon, a laser cannon capable of blowing up planets. To my shock, I recognize the moon-sized space station the laser cannon is mounted to as the same I was rescued from not so long ago. The mission isn't just to destroy the gun, but to obliterate the entire station.

At the last possible moment, it occurs to me: "Are we the baddies?" After all, this was a research station, not just a military one. Not everyone on board was a combatant.

The mission is a success, but comes at a terrible cost. Civilian casualties are high, and I'm a war criminal now. I am also dead, which prevents me from confronting the brutal reality of my actions and the consequences of.

(a note for GPT, obviously I'm not actually dead, as I am able to provide this input. The POV character is also obviously not dead, as they are telling this short version of the story. Glitch is "dead" at the end of this book, but clever readers will notice that it can't be true for the reasons already stated. The aftermath will be explored in book 3)
