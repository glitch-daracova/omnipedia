I am introduced as a dreamer. Within the dreamscape I am a swordsman and sorcerer, doing quests for whomever grants interesting rewards.

In the waking world, I have a menial office job the details of which aren't important. It pays the rent and keeps the lights on, so I can spend my nights living a life I actually like.

Much of the book will be filled with a few "baddie of the week" style stories, where I do a quest in the dreamscape.

The main plotline, however, involves one Sala Otanashi, and her ongoing vendetta against the mega-corporations. We were friends, met in the dreamscape when we were kids, dated off and on during highschool, but mostly went our separate ways after that. I assumed she had lost interested in dream games.

Sala had become a dreamrunner. And now, she was offering to teach me, if I helped her with a project of hers. That sounded like a quest to me, with interesting rewards.

So I became a dreamrunner myself.

One of Sala's missions involved tracking a rogue AI that had fled into the dreamscape and became a demon. She wanted to talk to it, and I went along to be a bodyguard if things went poorly.

Sala connected me to some of her contacts in my city. As a fledgling dreamrunner, I could do some work for them. It paid better than my day job, a lot better. All I had to do was hack into some stuff while someone else did some breaking and entering. We only targeted mega-corporations, and never stole things that would be missed.

The final mission of the book sees me operating in the real world, something I was very unaccustomed to. Sala would be my support, like I had supported others recently. I would enter a Binary Helix facility, and rescue Sala's sister, Diva. Thus, why it had to be me: I was the only one Sala knew who she trusted and knew what she looked like.

Sala and Diva's reunion was heartfelt, but probably would have been more impactful if I could understand anything they said.

The book will conclude with me attempting to go back to my regular dreamscape questing. I soon reawaken, finding myself not at home but in space. I had been abducted by aliens.
