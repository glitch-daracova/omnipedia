RAZIKALE _Fear the powers of the Empress._ Role: Executioner Title(s): The Shadow, The Beast Domain(s): Death, Mystery, Punishment Channel: Fear Specialty: Void Magic Personality: Gluttony

Razikaleâ€™s role is usually basking in the fear of beings terrified by her dread presence alone, while acting as Dumat's "antithesis" to help him expand the Cult. The Fear she and the Imperium instill in any being strengthens Razikale. When she is summoned to Punish, itâ€™s meant to be a rare and grand display of the Imperiumâ€™s terrible power, making an example out of the target. Razikale is the most deadly yet obscure of the Seven, known to bring abrupt death without a battle ever ensuing.
