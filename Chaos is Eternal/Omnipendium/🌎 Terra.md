# History of Terra

## The Before Times
Spanning all of human history measured in Anno Domini and earlier, this era encapsulates the rich tapestry of human development—from the earliest civilizations through the technological and cultural milestones that define modernity. It lays the foundational philosophies, early scientific achievements, and cultural dynamics that pave the way for the radical changes of the future eras. Key events and figures from this period continue to influence the principles and conflicts of the subsequent ages.

## The New Age
The onset of the [[📅 New Age]] is marked by the transformative [[📆 Singularity Event]], a pivotal moment that blurred the lines between technological innovation and human evolution. The exact transition from Anno Domini is debated, but the New Age officially begins amidst the flourishing [[📅 Second Renaissance]]. This era represents a critical shift in human history, where traditional boundaries are redefined and humanity steps into a realm of unprecedented possibilities.

## The Second Renaissance
Already underway when the [[📆 Singularity Event]] catalyzed the transition into the [[📅 New Age]], the Second Renaissance is a period of extraordinary cultural and technological flourishing. This golden age saw the construction of [[⚙ Megacities]] to accommodate booming populations, and the establishment of thriving colonies on Lua and later Mars. Advancements such as widespread mechanical augmentation and the invention of the [[⚙ Dreamcatcher]] significantly enhanced human capabilities and experiences. This era of intense innovation and expansion laid the groundwork for the profound transformations and challenges that followed.

## The Great Exodus
Near the end of the Second Renaissance 7165NA, all the world's most wealthy and powerful individuals boarded the Ark, Earth's first interstellar vessel, headed towards [[🌌 Sigma Draconis]]. This was known as the [[📆 Great Exodus]]. They took with them state of the art AIs and the intellectual property rights for all the companies they owned. Strangely, someone on board owned the rights to call the planet they lived on Earth, and thus Old Earth has become Terra.

## The Age of Disaster
This dark period is marked by a series of catastrophic events that profoundly shaped the course of human civilization on Terra. Beginning with the ecological collapse in 7166NA, shortly after the [[📆 Great Exodus]], the planet's environmental systems failed dramatically, initiating a phase of technological stagnation where progress slowed and, in some cases, regressed. Despite this, the human population continued to grow, adding further strain to the already precarious conditions. The subsequent outbreaks of the zombie plague in 7875NA further destabilized global societies, leading to the creation of the [[🏛 WISE 🌎]] to restore order. The crescendo of disasters culminated in the 8342NA robot uprising, where Artificial Intelligences challenged human dominance, sparking the [[⚔ Terran AI War]]. Each apocalypse forced humanity to adapt and evolve in the face of overwhelming odds and limited technological support.

## The Modern Day
Beginning in 10599NA, the Modern Day marks a period of recovery and adaptation following the Age of Disaster. As technology slowly began to progress once again, humanity explored new ways to rebuild society and stabilize the various crises that had dominated previous centuries. This era is characterized by a precarious balance between technological innovation and maintaining control over the lingering threats from previous disasters—environmental, biological, and artificial.

In 19969NA, [[👑 Chad Thunder]] ascended to the role of [[👑 Sovereign Administrator]] of the [[🏙 American Megacities]], marking a significant era of leadership that has continued for 42 years and counting. Under his administration, the American Megacities have seen stability, technological advancement, and increased centralization of governance, setting a model that has influenced urban administration worldwide. Thunder's leadership is notable for its focus on integrating advanced security measures to safeguard against any resurgence of past calamities, particularly AI threats and ecological vulnerabilities.

Today, in 20011NA, the world of Terra is a complex tapestry of advanced urban centers and rehabilitated wildlands, where the remnants of old threats lurk in the shadows of a technologically integrated society. The focus remains on strengthening the human condition, improving life within the megacities, and cautiously expanding into previously uninhabitable areas. The challenges of the Modern Day are as much about managing prosperity and technological capabilities as they are about learning from the stark lessons of the past.
