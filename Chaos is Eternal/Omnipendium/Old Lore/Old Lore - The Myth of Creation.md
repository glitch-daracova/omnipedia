_ In the Beginning, the World was without form. There was only Chaos, and Darkness. Then, an Outsider found the World and spoke:

```
> su
> ********
> yum install worldgen
> yes
> worldgen mkworld Erewhon
> yum install worldsim
> yes
> worldsim load Erewhon
```

_ Suddenly, the World changed. In an instant, Day was separated from Night. Water receded from Land to form Oceans. Plants grew and Creatures where born. All was right with the World, and the Outsider left, never to be heard from again.

_ However, the World was not done. Frightened and alone, Man was born. He knew not where, nor who, nor even what he was. Man looked upon the World and began to look for answers.
