# Adventures in Erewhon: It’s a New World

_ The night air was still and cool as a lone figure surveyed a field of rubble and ruin. What was once a great city lay razed to the ground. Innumerable skeletons lay scattered about, flesh long since picked from the bones by carrion birds and scavenging beasts. Care would have to be taken to make sure that this didn’t become home to a new necromancer, it simply wouldn’t do to have an undead infestation in newly conquered territory.

_ Excitement grew in the cloaked man’s heart. There was always a period of lawlessness on new frontiers, after native militaries where exterminated but before total dominance gets established. There would be rebels, insurrectionists, opportunists turning to banditry, and other outlaws. Those who could apprehend such pests where often well compensated. Bounty houses where never short on coin.

_ Lightning flashed in the cloudless sky and the landscape was once again barren of life.

_ The next morning a former king awoke to terrible news. His longtime friend and rival, the baron of a nearby land was found dead. His corpse, along with that of his most trusted bodyguard, was found rotting on the side of a road like a commoner killed by bandits for petty coin. Where it not for the magical engravings on the baron’s bones, the bodies would probably never had been identified.

_ With his morning meal, the former king took more bad news. The army that had decimated his neighbors to the west had finished doing the same to his neighbors to the east. In less than a year, the three great powers of the realm had fallen to an unstoppable oppressor.

_ A midday meal was not eaten, as supplies were short were needed to last for the unforeseeable future. Bad news was received yet again though. Many of the tunnels up ahead had collapsed, so the way to the deep roads would be longer and more convoluted than predicted. He didn’t panic though, a king should never show fear in front of his men. This didn’t change the ever present reality of the situation, that they would all likely die from starvation before the enemy caught up on their heels.

Adventures in Erehwon Chapter 2: It’s a New World.

__ Those of you who are in on the making of this story have already read this when I first posted it on facebook, but here it is again for the sake of completeness. To anyone who may stumble upon this later on and (if I’m lucky) become a fan, I’m sorry you’re in the dark on past events. I’m working on it._

_ Welcome back to the world of Erewhon. A year has passed since the fall of the City of Brinstar. Despite initial resistance, the defense of the city was easily overcome by the superior force of the Empire of Phobos. No one knows what became of the would-be heroes who led the city to its demise. When the gates finally broke, it wasn’t a battle but a slaughter. None who remained in the city were allowed to live.

_ Behind the army, Imperial Geomancers began changing the realm to better suit the Emperor’s dominance. Grass turned red as blood, and spread like a plague through the local vegetation. Creatures of darkness were summoned and consumed the native wildlife.

_ Prophets of the Emperor traveled the land, establishing residence in every town and city not completely destroyed by the Emperor’s army. They set the new law, the Law of the Emperor. And the first of the Emperor’s Laws instructed all to dedicate their lives to His will as servants, slaves, or as dead.

_ The prophets also decreed all non-Imperial currency as contraband. All trade is to be done with His approval, or not at all. Imperial coins will be described in a separate document, but like all currency, their validity can be confirmed by most of the usual methods.

_ I hope you’re as excited as I am.
