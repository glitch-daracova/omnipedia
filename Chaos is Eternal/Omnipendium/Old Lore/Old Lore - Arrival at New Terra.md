Time is relative. If nothing changes, then has any time really passed? With nothing to act as a reference, does time even exist? I pondered these questions as I floated through the emptiness of the void. I tried counting my heartbeats, which proved unreliable. My synthetic heart was modelled after the organic one I used to have, so it was prone to change pace depending on subconscious stimuli. Inconvenient, but a small price to pay to retain what little humanity I had left. I tried counting again.

My mind of course would wander to what came before, the great and terrible things I had done. Everything leading up to this point seemed so justified, until the consequences began to set in. It was my fault, of course. All of it could have been avoided if I had just killed the bastard the first time.

I started counting again. Given the lack of a stiff drink, it was the only distraction I had, and not even a good one. Not that this period of self reflection was bad, it was just unbearably boring. There was simply nothing to do but wait.

So I waited.

Forever.

You would think that the tiny pinprick of a distant star would be utterly unremarkable. Believe me, at the time it was the most wondrous thing imaginable. Quickly my vision was overwhelmed as I was engulfed in color and heat! Matter and radiation danced in a bombastic display of vibrancy.

Then all was still.

My back was stiff against the cold metal table. I had found myself staring directly into the sixty watt bulb of the ceiling light. Everything hurt. Alive is not a bad start to my day. There were wires taped to my chest, I removed them.

Plastic boxes featuring displays and dials complained all around me. Someone was obviously taking advantage of my weakened state and trying to study me. Also obviously, they learned little of value as they didn't bother to tie me down, not that it would have helped. Judging by the machines, this was a human colonized world with early twenty second century level technology. How quaint.

I ran a diagnostic on my own systems. Microfusion reactor at 6%. I'd need to find fuel within the next decade or so, or resort to less savory forms of energy production. Skeletal integrity was within acceptable parameters, although there was evidence that severe fracturing had recently been repaired. Synthetic replicas of organs I once possessed were bruised but healing. Many subsystems were offline pending repairs, but everything critical checked green.

I left the room.

A paper gown is not what I'd consider proper adventuring attire, but it's what I had. If I bumped into anyone wandering the pale halls, I could at least feign modesty. Laminate flooring, tile walls, cheap construction. No doubt made by humans, the only race that is both so greedy and so wasteful. 

I found the lobby and exited the hospital. Someone I assume to be a receptionist tried to stop me, but my translation software failed to parse anything they said. I ignored them as I walked out into the cool night air.

A parking lot, an open street. Buildings of glass and concrete on all sides stretching to the sky. No guards. Nothing stopping me from walking away. So I walked. Between the street signs, billboards, posters, graffiti, and whatnot, my translation software was working overtime trying to figure out the written language. That could be set as a background task, it would take weeks to be useful.

Weeks. What a wonderful unit of measurement. So easy it was to slip back into normalcy that I almost didn't notice. It was nice. But it could be better. 

Priorities. In no particular order: clothing, fuel, weapons, shelter, information. And a motorcycle. I always wanted a motorcycle.
