As Zalazan and Wexlo left the meeting hall and the doors closed behind them, discussions continued amongst those gathered.

ALZAEL

> “Michael, you’ve been rather quiet over there. Anything you’d like to add before we get out of here?”

MICHAEL

> “Tyrael has been briefed on my plans, I trust his ability to disseminate information as needed.”

ALZAEL

> “So the heroes don’t need to know the real reason you want Athetos out of the picture so bad?”

ZANE

> “I wouldn’t have told them either. What if they were captured and forced to talk before they could be recovered?”

ALZAEL

> “Let me approach this from another angle, when were you planning on telling ME?”

A silence lingers over the room for several seconds. MICHAEL

> “Never. Either you or Hadrael would have spilled the beans, and then the entire multiverse would know how vulnerable we are. I could not accept that risk.”

KARI

> “What are you guys even talking about? I thought we were crushing some bad guys and stealing their stones?”

HADRAEL

> “Your grand mummy was kidnapped about a thousand years ago, and this guy” (gestures at Michael) “didn’t bother telling anyone.”

MICHAEL

> “Hey, I told Tyrael and Uriel. We were even about to resolve the situation before everything started going sideways.”

ALZAEL

> “Oh, so you told Uriel. Where is he now, I wonder? Oh yeah, the Black Fire Bastards have him!”

MICHAEL

> “Your unsanctioned actions are what put us on their radar! Had you just waited-”

JANE

> “ENOUGH. Your squabbles do not help here. We have an assault to plan. Adnora, you’re leading this operation, you sure you’re up to it?”

ADNORA

> “Don’t patronize me sister, I held this place together in your absence, didn’t I?”

RANDRUUR

> whispers to Conian “Are you sure these are the allies we were looking for? They seem… uncivilized.”

CONIAN

> whispers to Randruur “Truly. But what other choices do we have?”

The War Council, as they grew to call themselves, continued for several hours. Maps were exchanged and analyzed, weaknesses discovered. Using Wexlo’s contact as an entrance, Adnora and the others would quietly arrive in Athetos’s private hell. At Wexlo’s request, Tyrael would come along to provide support. Their first target would be Nolan’s altar. If timed to coincide with Athetos’s next military excursion, it might be assaulted with minimal resistance.

Meanwhile:

Kari and Azka would leave with Michael so that the super weapons Ea and Rule Breaker could be examined and potentially replicated.

Randruur would stay in the Land of Dreams, assisting Jane and Zane in improving the realm’s defenses. Perhaps new weapons could also be devised, by marrying scifey technology to Gabrael’s madness?

Kai and Sora would leave with Conian. The scifey strategist was to ensure that the Black Flame Imperium’s expansion into the material realms was as slow and painful as possible. He had special plans involving the two godlings to do just that.

Alzael would travel the realms, ensuring that local heroes had the means to stop any dragon cults from summoning the recently revived Tiamat. This would of course involve a visit back to Agraria, and the heroes guild led by Surina and Kane.

Hadrael would coordinate efforts between the new allies, assisting where needed.

The next day, the party gathered at the center of the Golden Palace, and vanished into another realm.
