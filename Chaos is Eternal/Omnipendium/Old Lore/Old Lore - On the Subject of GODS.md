_ Before talking about the gods themselves, first we should discuss what constitutes a god. Where do they come from, and why do they bother taking interest in the lives of mortals?

_ The most common gods are those created by man, or rather, created by the beliefs of man. Over time, people share their beliefs with others, and they create ritualized devotions to these ideas, which gives those ideas power. When enough people believe the same thing, that belief can take on a life of its own. This is called the Spark of Divinity, the moment when the idea itself becomes able to think and influence the world through those who share that idea.

_ People are inherently selfish, so the gods they create are usually also selfish. A selfish deity will of course want to increase its own power and influence, and the best way to do that is to institutionalize worship of itself. Enter, the church (or mosque, or synagogue, temple, whatever).

_ Other gods are actually ascended mortals. Demigods are those who are uplifted by an existing deity, riding on the power of another to gain divinity. Children between gods and mortals also count as demigods. Then there are those rare few who ascend to godhood through their own efforts. This is done by mimicking the process by which normal gods are made, but instead focusing on a person instead of an idea. They are called titans.

_ So that answers where gods come from, but what about the other question? Why do they take interest in the lives of mortals? The shortest answer is that they have to in order to survive. Gods are sustained by the faith and devotion of their followers. Without a foundation of faith, gods can wither and die. They have a vested interest in making sure they have growing population of devout believers. How the gods do this varies based on what they are a god of, and what beliefs the followers hold.
