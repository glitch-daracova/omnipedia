**Just a forenote: lots is being left out. This is intentional specifically so that this post remains brief. If I included all the details, well, there's literally five years of stuff to go over.

The year was 1014 of the Fourth Age. The six kingdoms of Agraria where at peace.

That is to say, they were not actively at war with each other, nor was there any cataclysm threatening to end the world. Peace, however, was not peaceful.

In the Free and Independent City States of Olympia (more commonly called 'Former Olympia'), people lived in poverty while ruling elites lived in luxury.

In Fretalia, humans and elves bickered over the growth of cities versus the preservation of the forests.

In Rodinia, the Crimson Guard held the eastern border against the unrelenting tide of orks that wanted nothing less than to ravage civilization. Everything that kingdom had went to that effort, to the detriment of their own people.

In Greater Anglica, a plague ravaged the countryside. The island was cut off from all trade and travel by the other kingdoms.

In Einroth, the dwarf clans captured people of other races, and sold them as slaves to the empire across the sea.

In Jarlheim, warriors of great renown where bored stiff.

Everything changed when a group of self-proclaimed "heroes" marched on the Baron's palace in Brinstar. No one knows what was spoken of, but the Baron fled for his life (and was later found dead out in the countryside), leaving a group of unproven adventurers to wrestle the city into a new order.

Soon after, a messenger from the Empire arrived asking why trade had ceased. The adventurers told the messenger to fuck off, and off he went. In response, the Empire sent an army. The City of Brinstar was raised to the ground, and Imperial forces conquered the rest of Agraria in a matter of days. The "heroes" responsible were presumed dead.

But it was not the case. They escaped, but where scattered.

A year passed, it was now 1015 of the Fourth Age. Kane, and old mercenary turned paladin began to form a resistance centered in Fretalia. He gained the support of old friends and new allies, and even managed to sway some Imperial forces to his cause. With a little help from the angel Alzael, they managed to push the Empire of Phobos back out of Agraria over the next two years.

While a great victory indeed, it could not be savored. The Empire would not stand for such setbacks, and an even greater army would soon be upon Argrarian shores. If this happened, the six kingdoms would fall again.

Kane was tasked with forming and leading an elite strike team to assassinate the God Emperor Kaiser Phobos. For this, he selected his best ranger Astra, and two powerhouse mages Kai and Sora. Together, they infiltrated the Imperial Heartland and rallied the populace into open rebellion. Under cover of this chaos, they attacked the Crown City, seat of Imperial power, and completed their mission.

It was Kai who executed the Emperor. In his dying breaths, he named Kai his successor: Kaiser Kai, God of Fear. In this moment, Kai witnessed a vision of green fire raining from the skies, desolating all in its path. "A storm is coming" the dying emperor said "a cataclysm beyond all reckoning. You must do what I could not."

Kane and Astra returned to Agraria, hailed as heroes. Their work was far from over though. The vision Kai witnessed lingered on all their minds. They must prepare.

A year passed. It was now 1018 of the Fourth Age. Kai called a meeting of old friends. Kane, unable to make the journey due to political obligations, sent his new ally Zalazan in his stead.

Arc 1: The Kingdoms of Agraria

  

_ The year was 1014 of the Fourth Age. The six kingdoms of Agraria where at peace.

_ hat is to say, they were not actively at war with each other, nor was there any cataclysm threatening to end the world at that time. Peace, however, was not peaceful.

_ To the south-east where the Free and Independent City States of Olympia (more commonly called 'Former Olympia'). Only holding the status of kingdom in retrospect. Economic collapse and assassination of ruling elites meant that it would be a long time before Olympia would be a kingdom again.

_ To the south-west was the Kingdom of Fretalia. The city-dwelling Altmer and the forrest loving Bosmer constantly argued over magical and societal progress versus the conservation and preservation of the natural order.

_ To the north-east was the Kingdom of Rodinia. There, the Royal Army and the Crimson Guard held the eastern border from the Orkwilds and the relentless Green Tide.

_ To the north-west was the Kingdom of Greater Anglica. Plague ravaged the island, and none dared travel there.

_ In central Agraria was the Kingdom of Einroth. Dwarven clans made themselves rich by capturing people of other races and selling them as slaves to the Empire across the ocean to the west.

_ To the north was the kingdom of Jarlheim. These northmen where great warriors, and where bored stiff by peacetime.

  

_ Call it coincidence, or call it destiny, when a group of adventurers all found themselves passing through a small town in Einroth at the same time. Old Sorpigal was nested in a valley, the only easy passage through Einroth's Allaganean Mountains. North would bring you (eventually) to Castle Eisenfoust, home of King Ember Eisenfoust of the Eisenfoust clan. South would bring you (eventually) to North Port, a center for trade with other cities lining the Central Sea (Agraria to the north of the Central Sea, and Arechia to the south).

_ Kane was a mercenary from southern Arechia, beyond the endless deserts. An old veteran of many wars.

_ Jack was a ranger with tremendously bad luck and little regard for anyone not his friends.

_ Jazzy, Jack's sister and moral compass, was an accomplished mage and martial artist.

_ Sora was a sorcerer with a natural talent for lightning.

_ Kai was a powerful sorcerer constantly wrestling with a literal demon inside himself. Although he couldn't go anywhere himself due toÂ  being trapped in a crystal prison held by:

_ Masu, the greatest wizard known to Agraria. Short in stature, but wise beyond expectations.

_ Dex, a Drow from the Underdark beneath Agraria. Unhappy with what little standing he could acquire in the Drow Matriarchy, he sought his fortune on the surface.

_ Ed, an awakened horse who accompanied Dex on many adventures thus far.

_ Surana, the only (adopted) daughter of Bahamut. Strong of heart, but dim of mind.

_ Some individuals where left off this list because despite passing through Old Sorpigal around the same time, they left the main party behind and didn't return for quite some time if ever.

_ This party didn't all travel together, nor adventure together. But they knew each other, and reconvened back at Old Sorpigal many times before venturing out again. Eventually, they would all find themselves in the Shining City of Brinstar, each there for their own reasons.

_ Surana was feverishly angry about the slave trade. With Kane at her side, she paid the Baron Valdemar a visit at his estate, while their other friends kept the guardsmen busy outside. No one knows what was discussed behind closed doors, but ultimately control of the city was handed over to Surana, and the Baron fled the city. It was this very moment
