>Alzael to Ikarus, Alzael to Ikarus. Come in, Ikarus. This is a secure line, I know you're getting this. Ike, what the hell? I've been trying  to get ahold of you for a week now. You don't want to talk? Fine. I've got some intel for you, so don't complain later that I didn't help. Just check your damn messages before the century ends, ok?

>There's no true ID matching this guy, which indicates he's third generation or younger. This would be good news for a gen two like yourself, except that he's been in this universe a lot longer than we have. There's no telling​ how much time dilation is on his side, and there's no telling what universes he's passed through before coming here. What's worse is that he can spoof his own aura signature, so he doesn't even read as one of ours. Do not engage until you're sure you have the right target.

>Another curse in disguise is his archaic power​ sourcing system. It's… weird. And several orders of magnitude greater than a modern mana reactor. Speaking of mana reactors, when all this is over you should come in for an upgrade. The mk8 has been obsolete since the 580 Event. Anyway, on top of all that, his system is not compatible with our standard lockdown protocols. You might try using dimensional containment fields to isolate the target from his power source, but it will have to be perfectly calibrated to work.

>The only truly good news is that he shouldn't be able to actually go anywhere. His central core, wherever it may be, should be tied down to a specific geographic location. Anything that happens to him outside of that location will have no permanent effect. Given your own physiology, you should be familiar.

>I'm working on my end of the plan, but you know how hard that is lately. Hell, I haven't even been able to talk to her since Mikky started acting strange. I swear, sometimes I think Fate makes things difficult for us on purpose. Side note: I know he can kick my ass six ways to sunday, but he's still pompous as fuck calling himself Fate. Seriously, what's up with that?
