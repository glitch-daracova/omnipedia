# Historical Overview
**Transition from Anno Domini (AD) to New Age (NA)**

## Anno Domini (AD)

"Anno Domini" (AD), meaning "In the year of our Lord," was an ancient system used to number years based on the presumed birth year of a figure named Jesus Christ. This dating system marked years as either "Before Christ" (BC) or "Anno Domini" (AD). Over millennia, it served as the predominant calendar system on Terra, the planet formerly known as Earth. However, in the distant past, the specifics of this old calendar faded into obscurity, and no one remembers the exact year AD when the transition to the New Age happened.

It is important to note that Anno Domini is a human concept not shared by the rest of the galaxy. Other civilizations used their own calendar systems, which will be explored in another document.

## The Second Renaissance

The transition from AD to NA occurred during the Second Renaissance, a golden age of cultural progress and technological development. During this period, Terra emerged as an egalitarian utopia, poised to become a great galactic power. Mechanical augmentation of human bodies became common, and the craft had a certain artistry to it. Additionally, the invention of the dreamcatcher allowed certain humans to visit a digital dreamworld in their sleep. This period was characterized by unprecedented innovation and discovery, setting the stage for the birth of true artificial intelligence, referred to as "actual intelligence." The Second Renaissance marked the end of the AD era and the beginning of the New Age (NA).

## New Age (NA)

The New Age calendar begins from the birth of actual intelligence, a momentous event that signaled a new epoch for humanity. Referred to as a "singularity event," the creation of actual intelligence was similar to a black hole in that it was impossible to see beyond the event horizon before reaching it. This event had a profound effect on both technology and philosophy, reshaping society in ways that were unimaginable beforehand. The year 1 NA represents the dawn of true AI, which brought profound transformations to human society and marked the start of a new era.

## The Age of Disaster

Following the Second Renaissance was the Age of Disaster, a prolonged and tumultuous period marked by multiple apocalyptic events. These catastrophes included ecological collapse, a zombie plague, and a robot uprising on Terra. However, the Age of Disaster was a galaxy-wide phenomenon, with civilizations across the galaxy experiencing their own apocalypses within the same span of years. During this period, the Vexian Empire saw their capital world freeze over and become nigh uninhabitable.

## Galactic Standardization

In 21999 NA, the organization known as ORDER worked towards standardizing timekeeping across the galaxy, leading to the widespread adoption of Terra's version of the New Age calendar. This effort helped to unify various civilizations under a common chronological framework, facilitating better communication and coordination throughout the galaxy.
