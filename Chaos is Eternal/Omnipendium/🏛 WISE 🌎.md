WISE proudly serves as a regulatory body that oversees the appointment of [ðŸ‘‘ Sovereign Administrator](../../-sovereign-administrator.md)s for the [âš™ Megacities](../../-megacities.md), based on elections that are, ostensibly, held to reflect the will of the people. WISE's stated primary goal is to ensure that peace is upheld and that the populace remains healthy and contentâ€”noble ambitions indeed. Officially, there is absolutely no corruption within WISE; its operations are as transparent as they are effective. Moreover, it is said that there is nothing nefarious at play behind its closed doors. Certainly, such assurances are given in the utmost good faith to all who inquire about the integrity and benevolence of this esteemed institution.
