# Sala Otanashi
As a [Dream Runner](Classüë©‚ÄçüíªDreamrunners.md), Sala Otanashi lives two lives.

**Age:** Mid-30s

**Gender:** Female

**Appearance:**

- **Waking World:**  
    Sala is a woman of fierce determination, with sharp features and a lean, muscular build. She has jet-black hair, usually tied back in a tight ponytail, and piercing amber eyes that seem to burn with an inner fire. Her skin is tanned, showing the marks of a hard life, with a few scars from past battles. She typically wears tactical gear‚Äîblack, lightweight, and designed for agility and stealth. A crimson scarf, a token from a lost comrade, is her only adornment, a silent symbol of her cause.
    
- **Dreamscape:**  
    In the dreamscape, Sala's appearance transforms dramatically. As Queen Sanguis, she is a being of otherworldly beauty and terror. Her hair is a cascade of deep red, flowing like blood, and her eyes glow with a predatory, crimson light. Her skin is pale, almost ethereal, contrasting sharply with her dark, regal attire‚Äîan elaborate gown of black and crimson, adorned with arcane symbols of power. She possesses large, bat-like wings, and her presence exudes an aura of dominion and fear. Her hands, ending in claw-like nails, are often stained with the essence of her enemies.
    

**Personality:**

- **Waking World:**  
    Sala is a determined and passionate individual, driven by a deep sense of justice and responsibility to protect the oppressed. She is resourceful, intelligent, and a natural leader, though often perceived as ruthless by her enemies. Her dual life forces her to be secretive, and she carries the burden of her actions in the waking world with a heavy heart. Despite being labeled a terrorist, Sala fights for a future where her people can live free from tyranny.
    
- **Dreamscape:**  
    As Queen Sanguis, Sala embraces the darker aspects of her nature. In this realm, she is unapologetically powerful, ruling over legions of demons and lesser vampires with an iron fist. Here, her justice is absolute, and her enemies are met with no mercy. While her goals in the dreamscape align with her waking world objectives‚Äîdefeating oppressive forces and securing freedom‚Äîher methods are far more brutal and direct. Yet, even in this role, she harbors a deep care for those under her protection, seeing them as her extended family.
    

**Background:**  
Sala was born in the slums of the Japanese megacity, a place where life was cheap, and the government‚Äôs control was absolute. Orphaned at a young age, she was taken in by a resistance group that fought against the oppressive regime. Trained in combat and strategy, Sala quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a key figure in the underground movement. Her life has been one of constant struggle, loss, and determination.

Sala‚Äôs journey as a dreamrunner began in her youth when she met Glitch Daracova in the dreamscape. The two quickly became friends, sharing their adventures in the dream realm. During high school, they dated off and on, but their paths eventually diverged, and they lost touch. While Glitch continued his life as a casual dreamer, Sala delved deeper into the dreamscape, evolving into a powerful dreamrunner with a vendetta against the mega-corporations that oppressed her people.

Sala reconnected with Glitch later, offering to teach him the art of dreamrunning if he agreed to help her on a critical mission. Their history and mutual trust made Glitch the perfect candidate for the job, reigniting their bond as allies.

**Powers and Abilities:**

- **Waking World:**
    
    - **Master Combatant:** Expert in hand-to-hand combat and proficient with a variety of weapons.
    - **Tactician:** Highly strategic, able to outmaneuver larger and better-equipped forces.
    - **Stealth and Espionage:** Skilled in infiltration, sabotage, and gathering intelligence.
    - **Psychic Hacking:** Using her dreamrunner abilities, Sala can extend her influence into the real world by psychically hacking into computer systems. This allows her to manipulate networks, disable security systems, and gather intelligence remotely. Her demon allies, transformed into daemons, can infiltrate and wreak havoc on networked infrastructure, corrupting data, disrupting communications, and causing widespread chaos.
- **Dreamscape:**
    
    - **Vampiric Powers:** Superhuman strength, speed, and agility. Can regenerate from most wounds by consuming the essence of her enemies.
    - **Demon Lordship:** Command over demonic forces and the ability to summon dark entities to fight for her.
    - **Reality Manipulation:** Ability to alter the dreamscape to her advantage, reshaping the environment and conjuring powerful spells.

**Motivations:**  
Sala's primary motivation is to free her people from the oppressive regime that has ruled the megacity for decades. Her actions, both in the waking world and the dreamscape, are driven by a deep sense of duty and a desire for justice. Sala‚Äôs commitment to her cause is further intensified by the need to protect her twin sister, Diva Otanashi, who is integral to her plans both in the real world and the dreamscape.

Sala also has a personal connection to Glitch Daracova, whose return to her life reawakens old memories and complicates her mission. Her trust in Glitch is strong enough that she entrusts him with the critical task of rescuing her sister, a mission that requires a delicate balance of their past relationship and their current objectives.

**Weaknesses:**

- **Waking World:**
    
    - **Human Limitations:** Despite her skills, Sala is still human, vulnerable to injury and the emotional toll of her actions.
    - **Isolation:** Her double life forces her to keep others at a distance, leading to loneliness and mistrust.
- **Dreamscape:**
    
    - **Overreliance on Power:** In the dreamscape, her immense power can make her overconfident, leading to potential vulnerabilities.
    - **Duality:** The constant switching between her two lives takes a mental and emotional toll, making it harder for her to maintain her grip on reality.

**Relationships:**

- **Diva Otanashi (Twin Sister):**  
    Diva is Sala‚Äôs twin sister, her closest ally, and confidante. The two share a bond that goes beyond mere sisterhood, forged through years of fighting side by side in both the waking world and the dreamscape. Diva is equally skilled in combat and dreamrunning, though her abilities are more focused on healing and protection rather than offensive power. In the waking world, Diva operates under the alias "The White Seraph," often taking on a more diplomatic and mediating role within the resistance, while still being a fierce warrior when needed. In the dreamscape, she manifests as the "Seraph of Dawn," a celestial being with radiant wings and the power to cleanse and restore. The sisters complement each other perfectly‚ÄîSala‚Äôs fierce and aggressive nature is balanced by Diva‚Äôs calm and nurturing presence.
    
    **Diva's Role in the Dreamscape:** As the Seraph of Dawn, Diva is Sala‚Äôs right hand in ruling their dominion. While Sala leads the charge with brute force, Diva ensures the stability of their realm by protecting their allies and repairing the damage done by their enemies. Her powers are crucial in countering other dream entities and maintaining the balance of their dreamscape.
    
- **Glitch Daracova:**  
    A longtime friend and former romantic interest, Glitch shares a complicated history with Sala. They met as children in the dreamscape, where they bonded over shared adventures and later dated during their teenage years. Though they drifted apart, Sala reconnected with Glitch when she needed his help with her missions as a dreamrunner. Sala trusts Glitch deeply, enough to teach him the art of dreamrunning and to entrust him with the critical mission of rescuing Diva. Their relationship is marked by a mix of nostalgia, trust, and the weight of their shared past, making Glitch one of the few people who truly understands Sala's dual life.
    
- **Allies:**
    
    - **Waking World:** Members of the resistance, a small group of trusted comrades who know of her dual existence.
    - **Dreamscape:** Loyal demonic generals and vampiric lieutenants who serve her with unwavering loyalty.
- **Enemies:**
    
    - **Waking World:** The ruling regime of the megacity, corporate enforcers, and rival factions within the resistance who see her as a threat.
    - **Dreamscape:** Other powerful dream entities who challenge her rule, and those who seek to invade or control the dreamscape for their own ends.

### Pandemon_ium: Sanctuary of the Damned and Seat of the Chiropteran Queen

**Purpose and Role**:¬†**Pandemon_ium**¬†is a unique realm ruled by¬†**Sala Otanashi**, the Chiropteran Vampire Queen and Demon Overlord. Pandemon_ium serves as a sanctuary for ‚Äúmonsters‚Äù‚Äîdamned souls, merciful demons, and persecuted undead. Sala‚Äôs vision for Pandemon_ium is one of redemption, aiming to prove that monstrousness is defined not by one‚Äôs birth but by one‚Äôs actions. Here, beings from across the multiverse can find refuge, purpose, and a path to redemption under Sala‚Äôs watchful guidance.

**Key Features and Inhabitants**:

- **Haven for Outcasts and ‚ÄúMonsters‚Äù**: Pandemon_ium provides a sanctuary for those rejected by other realms, including souls deemed unworthy of salvation, demons who refuse to embrace destruction, and undead seeking purpose. Sala‚Äôs rule creates a structured environment where outcasts can prove themselves through their actions, challenging common perceptions of their species or cursed states.
- **Chiropteran Chevaliers**: Unique to Pandemon_ium, the Chevaliers are elite, loyal warriors created only by a Chiropteran Queen like Sala. These Chevaliers possess an instinctual love for their queen and unique powers, often shaped for navigating and protecting the realm‚Äôs treacherous paths in the Breach. Their bond with Sala is unbreakable, rooted in a love that is both supernatural and deeply personal.
- **Pandemon_ium‚Äôs Gateway to the Breach**: Sala has mastered the more dangerous routes within the Breach, granting Pandemon_ium access to hidden pathways that connect to numerous realms. Her Chevaliers, in addition to being formidable warriors, are highly skilled navigators in these routes, making Pandemon_ium a valuable strategic ally for ORDER.

**Philosophy and Leadership of Sala Otanashi**:

- **Redemption and Choice**: Sala governs Pandemon_ium with the belief that monstrosity is a matter of choice, not nature. She offers those within her realm a path to redemption and purpose, judging them solely by their actions. Her leadership style balances mercy with discipline, ensuring that Pandemon_ium remains a safe haven without descending into chaos.
- **Ally to ORDER with a Unique Perspective**: Sala‚Äôs alliance with ORDER is based on shared values of stability and redemption, though her interpretation is uniquely her own. She occasionally provides ORDER with resources, intelligence, and access to her skilled Chevaliers, reinforcing ORDER‚Äôs operations in the Breach. Her influence has shaped some of ORDER‚Äôs containment strategies, especially concerning supernatural or ‚Äúredeemable‚Äù threats.
