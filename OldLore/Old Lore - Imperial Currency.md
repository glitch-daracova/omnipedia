_ The standard currency of the Phobos Empire and his territories is the Imperial Mark, usually found in the form of coins. Imperial coins are made of pewter, round with a square hole. The face side always depicts an octagram with a crown above it and feathered wings below. The reverse side is marked to denote the coin’s value.

_ Since these coins are made of common materials, attempts at making counterfeits are common but doomed to failure. As with non-Imperial currency, any merchant or banker blessed by the god of trade and fortune can separate the real from the fake almost instinctively. Common men can also check an Imperial coin’s authenticity by holding said coin in front of a light. The holder will be able to see an illusion through the hole of the coin showing the symbol of the Imperial treasury and the value of the coin itself. If multiple coins are held like this in a stack, then the total value of all those coins together. is shown.

_ Most merchants, bankers, and adventurers have a special coin pouch made by a priest of the god of trade and fortune. Such a pouch is capable of storing a near infinite of coins, and can exchange coins for different denominations of the same currency. These pouches cannot exchange Imperial coins for non-Imperial coins, nor vice versa. Whenever a person reaches inside, he will always find the amount he is looking for on the first try assuming enough money is inside.
