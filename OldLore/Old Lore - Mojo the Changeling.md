The History of Mojo

Mojo the changeling hails from the city of Tarbean, a loud and dirty city in a distant land where fantastical creatures were not accepted by society. She lived mostly on rooftops and in dark alleys. Orphaned at the age of ten, Mojo never knew her doppelganger father, and her elvish mother was burned as a witch by an angry mob. She hid herself as a human child, always fearing for her life.

Tarbean was a large city with many travelers, from which Mojo learned to mimic people of many ethnicities and social statures. A few years later, she snuck away with a circus pretending to be a contortionist, leaving Tarbean far behind and beginning a new life of adventure and excitement.

During the warm summer months, Mojo travels with her circus family. In winter though, she seeks her own fortunes and her own sense of self.
