_ Hey, me again. I forget if I’ve already told you this, but since I got back from Afterlife, I’ve been watching Erewhon pretty closely for potential heroes to send against the Empire. I’ve been focusing my efforts on the continent of Agraria, since that is the place most recently invaded by the Empire, I figure I can dredge up the most resistance there.

_ Last time I looked, four of my candidates have gathered themselves at / near a prison camp in central Fretalia. Occupation there isn’t too heavy, so I shouldn’t need to influence anything to get them to find each other.

_ One is an elder vampire, although I’m not sure what bloodline she is from. She’s sneaky and persuasive, and would be perfect as the party’s ambassador. To top it off, she knows the area. Her coffin is buried somewhere in Fretalia’s forests, and she has spent most of her past three hundred years in the country. That’s probably how she’s been avoiding the Inquisitors for the whole year.

_ The second is a human paladin, a veteran warrior although he has only been following his deity for the past year. Funny, he converted shortly before the Empire invaded, I’ll have to look into that coincidence. Since his mid-life crisis was so recent, his authority probably doesn’t carry much weight. At the very least, he’ll be a good tank, but I don’t expect him to be very useful off the battlefield. He was captured by an Inquisitor recently and is in the camp as a prisoner.

_ The third is a young human mage. He’s probably a sorcerer, as no wizard I’ve met was ever that good that young. He needs a lot of training in discipline (and I do mean a lot), but he’s got power. If he doesn’t accidentally kill everyone, he’ll be the party’s heavy damage. He’s in the camp as a prisoner as well, so far he hasn’t drawn any attention to himself.

_ The fourth is an elfish ranger. Probably the most patient fucker I’ve ever seen, he’s been hiding outside the camp for a week, watching everything unfold. He’ll probably end up being the party leader if he keeps up this attitude.

_ The fifth is a vampire monk. He looks like a child though, so if an Inquisitor catches him he’ll be headed to the Inquisitor’s manor in southern Fretalia. He seems like he’s good at evading pursuit, so I won’t worry about it. Besides, he’s headed in the direction of the camp anyway, so everyone will be together in a few days tops.

_ Here’s hoping everything goes according to plan. Heroes are in such short supply these days.
