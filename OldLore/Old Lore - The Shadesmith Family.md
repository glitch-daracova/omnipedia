# Lore by Alzael: The Shadesmith Family

In the confidence of Alzael Shadesmith.

_ In the event that Michael finds out what I am up to before I am able to complete my mission, I want to set the record straight. I guess that means I should start from the beginning. Well, maybe not that far back.

_ We have a rather large and convoluted family tree, and it all starts with one man: a damn-near omnipotent being we call the Allfather (not to be confused with the second pantheon deity Odin Allfather). His children, myself included, where created using himself as a template. I won’t go into the particulars, but suffice to say that the lot of us didn’t get along very well.

_ Some of us where less than perfect. Who am I kidding? We’re all flawed in some way. Michael has no sense of humility, and I don’t know if he believes his own hype or if he’s compensating for insecurities. Adam is an irresponsible little twat, he just uses the Mantle of Responsibility as an excuse to have fun without understanding what it actually means. Me, well, I have my own problems.

_ The thing is, some of my brothers turned out, well, badly. Just giving someone your own memories isn’t a substitute for a proper childhood. There was one that lacked a sense of empathy, so when he got pissed he would destroy everything in sight until someone stopped him. What’s worse is that the bad ones really liked to create their own little themselves without anyone knowing, and they pick up more and more problems with each ‘generation’, so to speak. But wait, it gets worse! One of the bad ones found out that he could kill a brother, and absorb all his power and memories to make himself stronger. It didn’t take long for everyone to figure that trick out and suddenly the entire realm turns to shit.

_ None of us live in the world we came from. We all have our father’s memories, we know what home was like. We all know where it should be. I miss it, I know my brothers do as well. We don’t go back, not because we don’t want to, but because we can’t. It doesn’t exist anymore. I don’t mean the home planet, that system, or even that galaxy. That entire universe no longer exists. I get asked a lot about what the Mantle of Responsibility stands for. Usually I give some kind of bullshit answer about protecting the innocent from tyranny, or whatever. I have a speech I like to give saying exactly that. I guess that’s true, but that’s only part of it. The real reason I carry the Mantle of Responsibility is so that what happened to my home never happens to anyone else’s.

_ But who are we? I suppose I never really answered that. There are four of us Shadesmith brothers still around, well, three now. Michael is the eldest, he’s responsible for making sure we all play our role in upholding the Mantle of Responsibility, as well as managing everyone employed by the family. He also handles the family’s relations with other cosmic agencies. I won’t even pretend to understand how he keeps up with all that.

_ Adam, “Hadrael”, is the youngest, but I was the last to formally join the family. He does what Michael tells him, but he draws a lot more attention than any of us would like. If you’ve ever heard any of the legends about men with the names of angels doing heroic things to change the course of history, that was probably Adam showboating to get in a woman’s pants. The rest of us just went with it because it works. I know I make fun of him a lot, but honestly I’m surprised his total number of children are in the single digits (well, children that I know of, I’m pretty sure he doesn’t know of any of them).

_ Garrett, “Gabrael”, is, well, was, responsible for making sure that none of our less morally inclined relatives cause any more H&D. He built and captained a prison ship he called Afterlife capable of containing even our most powerful brothers in isolation. Completely indestructible from the inside, not so much from the outside. I was there when it happened, but that’s a story for another time though.

_ Then there’s me, Alex, or “Alzael” as everyone outside the family calls me. I spend a lot of time advising politicians, which I absolutely hate doing because all the ones that need advice are morons and won’t take it. Or they kinda listen and do it wrong and fuck up everything. Because of that, I like to be more hands-on than Michael would prefer, and send parties of young adventurers on, well, adventures to fix their world’s problems. It seems to work, most of the time.

_ If you ever meet one of us, it can be pretty difficult at times to tell who is who since we all have the same face and voice. Most of the time we’ll be wearing our quite fancy color-coded attire, even then it isn’t a solid bet since we all love black. Michael keeps saying things about how our preferred colors reflect our auras, but I’ve never actually seen one so I can’t confirm.

_ I’ve been talking for a while now, I’d better get back to work. Apparently Michael has been asking difficult questions recently. I don’t want to give him more things to worry about.
