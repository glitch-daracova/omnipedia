The angel Tyrael was escorted to the head of the train by the demon Baalah (or was it Keemah?) and the snake-man Wexlo. The angel was promised something fantastic was waiting, but he had his doubts. Not that he suspected the snake-man to lie to him, oh no. Alzael was convinced that the entire charade was an elaborate trap, the only question was by whom it was set.

Despite needing to walk nearly the entire length of the train, it did not take long for the angel and his escorts to reach their destination. Wexlo opened the final door, entering first.

> My lady, may I introduce: Tyrael Shadesmith.
> 
> WEXLO

The snake-man bowed as he spoke, showing reverence.

> You may enter.
> 
> SALA OTANASHI

The voice was commanding without being overbearing. A difficult feat, but one mastered by the aged vampire turned demon lord. Her personal quarters aboard the train were lavish, if not spacious. Rugs and pillows were scattered everywhere, with a chair befitting a demon lord square in the center. Upon this chair sat Sala Otanashi, someone that the angel thought he’d never see again in his life.

> The years have been kind indeed, you are as beautiful as remembered.
> 
> TYRAEL SHADESMITH

Barely a whisper, but audible to a vampire. As Wexlo watched, he could only assume telepathic communication was being used.

> Flattery will get you nowhere, Glitch. You’ve been gone a long time, what if I have another man in my life?
> 
> SALA OTANASHI

Subvocalized, but detectable by the angel’s sonic detection augments. He knew she was phishing for a reaction. She wasn’t going to get the one she wanted. That name didn’t apply to him.

> I’m glad you moved on. I did.
> 
> TYRAEL SHADESMITH

The silence was palpable, even to the onlookers. Postures stiffened, as both Sala and Tyrael felt distrust between each other.

> I need to know that you really are who you appear to be. Let me taste your blood.
> 
> SALA OTANASHI

She didn’t bother hiding her voice, nor the apprehension in it. Wexlo was visibly confused, he thought he brought together two old friends.

> If you are who you claim to be, then you can command me to do it.
> 
> TYRAEL SHADESMITH

Gazes locked, before she spoke again.

The Voice could not be disobeyed. Tyrael approached, and offered his arm. Sala bit into his wrist, drinking of the angel’s blood. After a moment, she looked up.

> You can go.
> 
> SALA OTANASHI

> Yes, I think we have much catching up to do.
> 
> TYRAEL SHADESMITH

Keemah (or was it Baalah?) turned to leave as Wexlo bowed again. Both left as told.

> And you, you have explaining to do.
> 
> SALA OTANASHI

> I’m not who you think I am. WE are not what you think we are. The late Glitch Daracova was my father. Do you see a problem?
> 
> TYRAEL SHADESMITH

Sudden realization washed over the vampire

> YES, oh god, no, fuck.
> 
> SALA OTANASHI

> Now try to imagine how I’m going to explain all this to the others without sounding obscenely creepy.
> 
> TYRAEL SHADESMTIH

> I get it. ……….. Sorry I missed your funeral. His, funeral.
> 
> SALA OTANASHI

> It’s fine. He went to yours. Open casket. You were dressed up in that green dress you liked. It was the only time he ever met your family.
> 
> TYRAEL SHADESMITH

The two continued to talk for several hours, completely oblivious to occurrences elsewhere on the train. Drinks were poured and consumed, blood for Sala, rum for Tyrael.

> It always felt strange, that I ‘died’ and wound up here. I guess it makes sense, in a way. You can get me out though, right?
> 
> SALA OTANASHI

> I can gate you to my ship, if that’s what you mean?
> 
> TYRAEL SHADESMITH

> No, OUT. I haven’t been able to log off the entire time I’ve been down here. The entire menu system is just gone.
> 
> SALA OTANASHI

> Sala, I don’t know how to break this to you, this IS the outside. There’s nowhere to logoff to.
> 
> TYRAEL SHADESMITH

> Don’t lie to me.
> 
> SALA OTANASHI

Hurt resounded in her voice, only to be replaced by anger.

> No, you’re afraid of me. You’re trying to keep me trapped to protect yourself.
> 
> SALA OTANASHI

> What? No. Seriously, watch. I can’t ‘logoff’ either.
> 
> TYRAEL SHADESMITH

The angel performs the arcane gesture, from which nothing happens. He repeats it for good measure.

> I trusted you. This is how you repay me? **K͈̺̮͕̝̾ͨ̎ͅN̬̝̮͉̭͚͙͎͙̓͂ͥ̑̄ͦ̊E͕͍̗̩̼͔ͭ̐̑ͅE̥͕͇͕ͥ̆ͤ̄́ͣͦ̌̊Ḷ̓͑͋̊̇ͨ.**

The angel falls to his knees, and the vampire rips out his throat with her teeth.

> Guys, recovering Sala is a lost cause.

> TYRAEL SHADESMITH

> How bad?
> 
> MICHAEL SHADESMITH

> She’s delusional, and homicidal. The good news is her command voice is a lot weaker than anticipated. I let her think it worked though.

> TYRAEL SHADESMITH

> Got rekt?

> HADRAEL SHADESMITH

> Be civil.

> ALZAEL SHADESMITH

> I’ll upload memories of the event once the Azurath is out of the ethereal plane. In the mean time, I need to build a new body. I’ll be out of touch until then.

> She’s hot though, right?
