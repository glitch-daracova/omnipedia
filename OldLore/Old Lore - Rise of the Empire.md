# Lore by Alzael: Rise of the Empire

_ In the confidence of Alzael Shadesmith.

_ Did I ever tell you about how the Empire came to power? Why am I asking, you never say anything. Back in the day, the place used to be called North Aethyr. I had a vacation house on top of the tallest mountain on the continent from which I could see everything from coast to coast. A beautiful view. I spent a month of every decade there. The family business wasn’t very organized back then, so I could take time off whenever I wanted.

_ One day while I was there this dude shows up. He was probably, I don’t know, twelve? Ish? Something like that. Disirregardless, he’s lucky I saw him coming otherwise I wouldn’t have been wearing pants. Now, oxygen is real thin up at that elevation, and he had no kind of gear to help with that. his clothes where ragged and torn, he was a mess. Myself on the other hand, I was wearing my finest whites (oh I was such an asshole back then), he must of thought I was some kind of god.

_ So, he walks up to me and practically collapses at my feat from exhaustion. He asks me, get this, he asks me to read his fate. Well, do you have any idea how much paperwork is required to get a foreground check on someone? Fuck that. So, did you ever watch Dune? [You know how they do the voice?](https://youtu.be/VKQMWZHiQVQ?t=1m40s) Yeah, so I do that and I tell him:

_ “The future is a dangerous place, young one. There’s a storm coming, and no one can see it. A cataclysm beyond anything you can possibly know.” He’s glowing in the face, torn between eagerness and fear. He wants to ask what he can do, but is too enraptured to speak.

_ I continue “You will go back to the world below and train to become a soldier. You will prove yourself in battle and rise to become a general of a king’s army. You will gain his trust, and be named his second should ill befall him before his son come of age. It will, and you will become king-regent. From there you will expand your power to be king of all the world. One day though, you will fall. And in a moment of weakness, when you are unable to protect your people, the Storm will break upon this land with a vengeance, destroying everything you ever built.”

_ His expression slowly changes from trepidation, to glee, to terror as I spoke. He has the audacity to ask me why I must be so cruel. I tell him “Then prove me wrong. Now get off my mountain.”

_ He leaves, crying like a little bitch, and I thought nothing of it. Oh don’t worry, I made sure he had an easy time climbing back down, it’s not like I was a total douche back then. I had a vacation to enjoy though and I wasn’t going to let one snot-nosed twerp stop me from doing a lot of nothing while I had the chance.

_ Ten years later I come back and there’s a fucking city sitting IN THE FUCKING MOUNTAIN where MY FUCKING VACATION HOUSE fucking USED TO BE. Now, I realize that it’s kinda obvious in hindsight, especially when I gloss over how busy I was over the intervening decade in the telling of it, but it took me a while to figure out that the same kid that I talked to ten years ago had installed himself as the King of North Aethyr. Kaiser Phobos, that was his name. Who the hell names their kid Kaiser? Dafuq?

_ So, I’m pissed, right. I go down to his castle where he’s throwing a party for the noblemen that supported him over the past few years. I put on my finest whites and drop in on a bolt of lightning. That got everyone’s attention.

_ I point my finger at him and I yell “I thought I told you to stay the fuck off my mountain!”

_ He don’t even flinch. “You told me to get off your mountain. You said nothing about coming back. And when I did, you weren’t there. One day I will be an emperor, and my rule will span across all worlds, just you wait. When your storm breaks upon my lands, you will find me unwavering.”

_ Alright, you know how much I hate it when someone else monologues at me. I believe in respect though, and I let him finish, but that was about it. I was ready to tear off some heads in there when my little brother (Adam) shows up on a second bolt of lightning. We argue. He was trying to be reasonable. I wasn’t having it. Usually it’s the other way around (we both knew it, and he tried to use that against me, it didn’t work). It escalates and we fight, right there in the dining hall.

_ The shockwave from my first punch killed half the people in the room, and severely injured almost everyone else. barely managed to throw up a containment field around us before my second hit landed on him. From an outsider’s point of view, we just disappeared and seven days passed in a flash. We where fighting that entire week. Adam has never beaten me in a fair fight, but then again he never fights fair to begin with. It took, well, a week, but we both exhausted what reserves we kept outside power lockdown. He got a commendation after that, I got a thousand years solitary containment.

_ A lot can happen in a thousand years. Apparently Adam had a kid, a real one. Like, he actually got laid and got a woman pregnant, had a kid. I didn’t think he had it in him. I wonder how old she is? Big Boss looks like she let herself age a year. I guess she finally realized that people outside the family don’t really take her seriously since she looks like an eight year old. And this place? Well, a thousand years ago the new god of war was sailing south because he ran out of gods to kill. That was fun to watch.

_ Long story short, it’s all my fault. Now I’m back and I’m trying to do something about it. Hopefully before anyone notices what I’m up to.
