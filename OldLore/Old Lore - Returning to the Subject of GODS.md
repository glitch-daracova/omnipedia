Returning to the Subject of GODS

_ There are many forms of higher beings, one of the most well known are gods. I have gone over what is and is not a god in previous documents, but for those who don’t remember or have not yet read my previous work, here’s a refresher.

_ Gods are a specific form of Higher Beings (higher in this context simply referring to having power greater than what is obtainable through natural or mundane means) that receive their power from the faith (be it worship, fear, or something else) of mortals. This means that the more followers that a god has, the more powerful that said god becomes. There is a caveat to this power though, and that is how gods are subject to the beliefs of their followers. This caveat is the subject of this document.

_ Why is it that every religion (even the ones that tolerate the existence of others) condemns heresy? I put forward two case studies.

_ In the time of the Third Pantheon of Erewhon, under the reign of Zeus, this King of Gods was well known for taking many goddesses, saints, and even mortal women into his bed. How did this happen? It started with the then young nation of Olympia, and every city wanting their own patron goddess to be the wife of Zeus. A marriage of political convenience to ally that particular city to Olympus forevermore. This of course happened many times, leading to Zeus having many wives, leading to him being rather liberal with his romantic relations, which lead him ultimately to being a man-whore who couldn’t keep it in his pants. For proof, see the origin of centaurs, satyrs, and pikachus.

_ This is but one way that the faiths of mortals can change a god. While my first example can be seen as amusing, my second is much worse.

_ In the time of the Fourth Pantheon of Erewhon, there was a resurgence in Elemental Gods in the form of the Elysian Gods. The God of Fire, Ignis, was seen to be a threat to the other Elysian Gods, and so a campaign of heresy was started to destabilize his power. Claiming him to be mad, a false god, not worthy of the worship offered to him, many mortals across the realms took to this belief with fervor. As more mortals where converted to this new faith, Ignis himself became more aggressive in his campaigns, and more hostile to the other Elysian Gods. Ignis, in his folly, never cared what the mortals believed specifically, so long as they continued to support him. His own followers of course believe him to be an enlightened god pursuing the progress of the future. However, since everyone else believes him to be insane, that is now a permanent part of him.

_ There is, of course, always more to gods than just this.
