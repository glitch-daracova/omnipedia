_ Eight months ago, a meeting was held between the white angel Alzael and five prospective heroes. Together they discussed the future of Agraria. The Empire had already assumed control over most of the land. Half of it had been utterly changed to fit their designs.

_ “I can do no more than influence events,” Alzael had said. “I leave the fate of this world in your hands.”

_ With hardened resolve, the party rescued captives and slaves all over Fretalia to build a secret army to resist the Empire. This army grew in numbers and in power as they stole weapons and armor. In only a few short months, they undermined the very foundation of the Empire’s occupation, which culminated in the assassination of the region’s High Inquisitor. Still, they where not yet ready.

___ More months passed and the resistance continued to grow. Whispers could be heard in dark corners that the god of dragons would save them. The people need more than a resistance. They need rebellion.
