# History of Erewhon: The Old(er) Gods

Originally posted October 31st, 2015.

_ It is generally accepted that the current pantheon of gods is the fourth to preside over the worlds. About once every million years, a catastrophic event will occur causing gods to die off en mass, this is called a Ragnarok. Whenever a Ragnarok happens, the skies rain fire, seas turn red and boil, plague spreads across the lands, it’s generally unpleasant.

_ Not much is known about the first pantheon, nor the first Ragnarok. It is said that the gods of the first pantheon where the most powerful to have ever ruled, and that the first Ragnarok was the worst cataclysm of any the worlds have seen before or since. The lack of detail is astounding.

_ The second pantheon took to the frozen north as their home. There, Odin ruled as the King of Gods. He grew what he called a World Tree, Yggdrasil, and built his own kingdom in it’s canopy. He called it Asgard, the realm of the gods.

_ Odin lived a long, fulfilling life as the king of gods, and many myths where created about him. Some true, some became true because people believed them, others remained just stories. As it is known, Odin could sleep for months, sometimes even years on end. Everyone could only hope that he would wake up again. It was during one of these long naps that Odin’s good friend and ally Fenrir murdered Odin. No one knows why. The second Ragnarok began.

_ It was an age of darkness. The tides of Evil began to pour from the far north. Odin’s son, Thor, and friends attempted to hold the evil at bay, but it was too much. In a final effort, Thor ordered the building of a great wall. This wall would be taller than the highest mountain and would span the breadth of the entire world. The Wall of the North would forever keep darkness away in the north.

_ The wall was a success. Sadly, even though half of the pantheon survived that Ragnarok, the people lost their faith in these gods’ abilities to protect them. The praise and worship largely stopped as the people searched for new gods. In response, the remaining gods moved southwards and changed their names in order to regain lost power. Thor became Zeus, King of Gods for the third pantheon.

_ As the people created and adopted new gods (and Zeus exerted his influence to get them all under his thumb), a new golden age of prosperity dawned. Problem was, Zeus got bored easy. He meddled with wars, bedded women mortal and divine alike, and generally did everything he could to avoid the responsibilities of a god.

_ The particulars where not recorded by history, but it is said that one day one of the people he “helped” got uppity and decided to go on a god-killing rampage. It worked. This mortal dubbed himself the new God of War, and personally wiped out almost the entire third pantheon. When he eventually ran out of gods to kill, he sailed south across the Great Sea in search of another pantheon (which he found, and killed them as well, but that’s another story). The current date is measured from the day Zeus was killed, 1015 years ago.

_ With this empty void of divine presence, the people where able to create entirely new gods that weren’t bound by the wills of surviving ones. They became the fourth pantheon, and now rule over most of Erewhon.
