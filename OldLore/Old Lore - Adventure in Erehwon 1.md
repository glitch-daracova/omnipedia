# Chapter One

Mines. Why where dwarves always in mines? Lyon contemplated these thoughts as he traveled deeper and deeper into the depths that likely hadn't seen a living soul in a millenia. Torch in hand, he could just barely see well enough not to trip on the cross-ties of the minecart track. Equipment lay scattered about, waiting for workers that never returned. The walls were rough stone and earth, the ceiling just a foot too low for comfort, and the air smelled... strange. None of this mattered to the lone adventurer, for his prize was worth the temporary discomfort.

Eventually, the tunnel opened up to a less dark cavern. A hole in the ceiling led straight up to the surface, or rather, to the top of the mountain these mines were under. Where it closer to mid-day, perhaps the cavern would be illuminated in sunlight. As it was, the underground was about as dark as, well, underground. The shaft extended downwards as well, and Lyon could faintly see another cavern below. A map would be rather helpful right about now.

The adventurer navigated around piles of discarded rock, and approached another tunnel on the other side of the cavern. Just as he was about to cross the threshold, time itself seemed to slow. Lyon could feel the hairs on the back of his neck prickle, his heart rate accelerated, he threw himself to one side to avoid incoming danger. Landing, he quickly looked around in the dimness. What had set him off? The sound of rocks tumbling, a muffled laugh, and a spark flying through the space he inhabited a mere second ago. The spark collided the ground with a thud, rolled a little farther down the tunnel, and thunder shook the entire cavern, lifting dust from every surface.

Gnomish explosives, thrown by a creature just as small but covered entirely in fur. The yordle jumped down from its perch on top of the rock pile, putting distance between it and its would-be prey, laughing uncontrollably all the while. Lyon felt adrenaline coursing through his veins, he merely closed his eyes, and let the shadows whisper to him as he drew his sword.

Scaling mountains was not something Jack particularly liked to do, but when epic loot was on the line, well, he did what he had to. It would be noon soon, and the trees did not provide as much shade as one would like. The blue-haired elf wiped sweat from his forehead and continued his trek. His metallic feet, which he was not yet accustomed to, crunched loudly against the earth, putting his experience as a ranger to shame. At least he had legs, even if they weren't his own.

A little farther and Jack spotted a cave, almost hidden by a giant rock. He paused at the entrance, uncertain if he should delay his quest to discover what may be inside. Curiosity won out, and in he went. Jack didn't have to go far to discover what kind of creature resided in this cave, spiderwebs covered every surface in increasing density the deeper in he went. Where the webs lacking, the elf might have noticed that the cave was not a natural formation. A small tunnel led into a larger chamber, where three giant spiders waited.

Now seeing the resident population, Jack slowed his movements, careful placing his steps to avoid notice. He managed to sneak around the spiders to the tunnel on the other side. Maybe they were sleeping? They didn't move, so Jack didn't care. Moving on.

By the time the elf reached the middle of the next tunnel, every surface was completely coated in webbing. Everything had a faint glow, as if the webs contained some kind of magic. Jack, the genius that he is, decided that the best way to proceed would be to burn a path so he wouldn't get stuck. He pulled a pinch of red powder from a pouch at his belt, made an arcane gesture, and threw fire from his hands to do just that. Seemed to work

The tunnel opened up to another large room, this one with more spiders than the last. Baby giant spiders clung to the ceiling and walls, while a group of adult giant spiders where clustered together in the middle. Jack was all set to just sneak past them as well (the spiders weren't moving after all, so they must be sleeping, right?), when the entire mountain shook. Loose rocks fell from all over, spiders jolted awake and hostile, and Jack was quickly surrounded.

The elf drew a pair of scimitars and swung at every spider to come near. Watching him was like watching a whirlwind, but metal and sharp with blood and bits everywhere. He was doing pretty well until he tripped over his own feet, face-planting the ground and giving the spiders a chance to jump on him. Jack felt a pain in the back of his neck as he reached for the pouch of red dust. Another arcane gesture, some focus, and the entire room went up in flames. The elf, however, didn't see it.

The day was calm, peaceful, serene even. The midafternoon sun was warm on Jasmerai's back as she walked the streets of the small town of Old Sorpigal. The townspeople were kind to the young elvish girl as she asked for directions to one shop and the next. She and her brother where only here to restock on supplies for the journey south. All she had to do was make sure that he didn't do anything... stupid.

Jasmerai was picking out dried and smoked meats when she heard screaming coming from outside. A thousand thoughts of disaster ran through her mind but they all came back to the same thing. She ran outside to see for herself, a mountain on the horizon was spewing smoke from its top. Wait, where the hell is Jack? Realizing that her brother was not with her the entire time, Jasmerai ran out of town towards the mountain. She wasn't sure how, but she was certain it was all Jack's fault. What could she do, but go find him?

Mid-afternoon turned to evening, and then to night as the elvish girl ran through the forest surrounding Old Sorpigal. With no one around (and who would see in the darkness anyway?), she turned her focus inward towards a more primal magic than most would ever consider.

Her skin rippled as hair, no, fur, grew in a wave across her body. Beneath the skin, the wave of change made alterations to her anatomy, strengthening muscles and adjusting bones to a figure she felt was more her own than the purely elvish body she inhabited moments earlier. Now in the form of a werecat, Jasmerai tore through the forest at alarming speeds. Now able to smell the trails left by those who came before, she knew she was on the right path.

The werecat arrived at a cave entrance, nearly obscured by a giant rock. Pausing for a moment, she sensed what was inside. She reached into the air beside her and pulled out a weighted metal staff. Now ready, the werecat entered the cave.

There are few things worse than cowardly opponents. Suicidal being one of them. Lyon raced down corridors deeper into the mines as said corridors collapsed behind him. He wasn't sure which was the worse thought, being crushed to death under the debris, or being cooked alive by the constantly heating environment? It was as if the massive explosion he fled from caused some kind of volcanic reaction within the mountain... Is that a light up ahead?

The adventurer was moving much too quickly to notice the change in architecture in the tunnels. Where before there was just roughly hewn stone and earth, now there was exquisitely detailed marble and quartz. Blocky scrollwork lined the walls studded with gems, and the floor tiles checkered and polished to a shine (where it not for the dust, of course). This tunnel led into a small temple, the sides of which lined with fire pits. Two rows of pews for dwarves to sit filled most of the floor, and the center isle led up to a simple altar shaped like an anvil.

Magnificent, that it was despite it's simplicity. Lyon's pace slowed as he entered the room with no visible escape. The corridor he traveled down to get here completely collapsed behind him, but luckily this temple remained intact. As he walked forward, the fire pits burst alight. The brightness was painful, for a moment, but the adventurer's eyes adjusted quickly. He didn't have time to waste, less so with the flames burning precious air.

With new light there was more to see. A sword lay upon the anvil altar, and a coffin was embedded into the back wall. This wasn't a temple, but a tomb. More lights, these seemed, different, as they emanated from the cracks in the coffin's surface. Before even thought, Lyon grabbed the sword from the anvil altar. His natural danger sense warning him of an unknown threat. The cracks glowed white, brighter and brighter until blinding as a different kind of thunder shook the tomb.

Suddenly, accompanied by the sound of cracking stone, all the lights went out leaving only darkness.

Then, a new shadow whispered in Lyon's ear:

Don't worry, I know the way. Follow me.

The night grew cold, and with it came rain. Not a real downpour, just enough drizzle to be annoying. Just enough to soak a man to the bone.
