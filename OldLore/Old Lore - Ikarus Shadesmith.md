Did you mean *Ikarus Vor19 (u512)*?

# Origin

Ikarus, son of *Seth Daracova (u404)*, was created during the *End War (u404)*. Just like Seth, Ikarus is but an incomplete fragment of his "father", splintered off both in body and mind using the pseudo-magical assistance of nanites. In this manner, Seth created many children for the purpose of waging intergalactic war against *Prism (u404)*, the *Allfather (disambiguation)*, and those who would later become the Shadesmith Family.

The plan Seth had for his children was a simple one: Harvest the universe of all available energies to fuel the war effort. The execution of the plan was not so easy. Many of Seth's children refused to give up the power they accumulated, and many of them turned to fighting and consuming their brethren to achieve even greater power. Seth not only participated in this internal conflict, but ensured to perpetuate by offering his own power as a prize to any of his children who became strong enough to take it. With a constant stream of challengers, Seth had an effectively limitless source of power.

Ikarus wasn't like his uncountable brothers, he didn't lust for infinite power nor did he desire to end everything that the Allfather fought so hard to protect. Of course, that didn't mean that Ikarus had to stay and help either. Using technologies based off of the hyperdrive, he found a way to leave the known universe. What he found on the other side was a universe filled with magic, real magic.

In the following decades, Ikarus traveled from planet to planet, simply enjoying life. He didn't realize that soaking up the ambient magical energies was making him more powerful than he had ever imagined, largely because he didn't need to use it. After a while, he effectively forgot that the End War was even happening.

That is, until a cosmic shockwave shook the universe (it actually shook the entire multiverse, but Ikarus didn't know that). If it weren't for the part where he was out in empty space at the time, he probably would have passed off the phenomenon as an earthquake. What Ikarus did not know is that ultimate weapons where being used back in his home universe, weapons capable of ripping holes in the fabric of space and time. Careless use of these weapons resulted in the utter and literal destruction of that universe.

Through some kind of cosmic coincidence, Seth appeared then in front of Ikarus. While Seth was dazed and confused by what he had just experienced, Ikarus was reminded of all the horror he had fled from and summarily killed his father without much of a fight. Well, "killed" as much as any being like Seth really can be killed. Ikarus did not consume Seth though, instead he compressed everything that was left and sealed it into a small box shaped object which he called (for lack of better terminology) a soul cube.

Later on, Ikarus met up with the newly formed Shadesmith Brotherhood (later to be known as the Shadesmith Family). Negotiations where made, and Ikarus handed over the remains of Seth for safekeeping. Ikarus himself was granted access to a number of resources and upgrades that the Shadesmith Brotherhood had to offer, so long as he agreed to have his powers restricted to help ensure that nothing like the End War would ever happen again. The alternative was living in a box like Seth for the rest of eternity.

## The Family Business

Formerly the Shadesmith Brotherhood, now the Shadesmith Family.

It is common knowledge that the Shadesmith Brothers are cosmic angels serving the Goddess of Light known as Prism. They are known to advise kings to prepare against threats greater than imagination, and in extreme cases, to be the defense the people need if the gods allow.

Most of that is complete and utter bullshit.

The Shadesmith Brothers often pose as angels to get wherever they need to be. Celestial beings are not to be trifled with, after all. Their primary concern is making sure that no rogue family member is left loose in the multiverse to wreak havoc and destruction on any scale. If help can be rendered along the way for other problems, great (many Shadesmiths feel compelled to, Mantle of Responsibility and all that).

Prism isn't a deity, but rather a true AI who is several millennia old and keeps the family business running. She's the only one that the Shadesmith brothers universally trust, and the only one they truly answer to.

Ikarus typically doesn't concern himself with the family business, as he isn't one of the eight Shadesmith Brothers. He still benefits from it though, mostly through the family name's reputation. Of course if the family calls, he can't say no (hence why he puts so much effort into being unreachable).

## Powers and Abilities

### Nanite Infection

The cornerstone and explanation of how and why all Ikarus's other abilities work. While it's not magic, it can both imitate and interact with magic. Someone who isn't familiar with nanites wouldn't even notice that magic isn't in play.

All the following is about nanites in general, rather than Ikarus specifically (it really should be moved to it's own page at some point). If all you're after is Ikarus information, you can safely skip to the next header.

So what are nanites? Nanites are sub-nanoscopic machines so small that they are theoretically impossible, and yet they are capable of self replication, self improvement, and manipulating their surroundings. Nanites where first discovered on a planet where members of the native population had suddenly started developing "magic powers". Even those who didn't experienced greater health, strength, intelligence, and longer life. Further investigation revealed that the source of these nanites was an artifact that was dubbed the Nanocell. This artifact baffled scientists for years, and the only explanation they could come up with for it's origin was that it came from another universe. Impossible, but that's exactly what happened.

The unknown truth of the Nanocell is that it serves a function not unlike an infinity stone in another multiverse that you probably know quite well. It frequently falls in and out of reality, bringing with it magic. Should it find itself in a universe that doesn't have magic, it creates magic, by whatever means it can.

As nanites can only be observed by using nanites (or by using magic, but that didn't exist where these experiments where done), it was difficult to learn anything substantial about them. Among the things learned though, was that nanites require three things: energy, material, and instructions.

A human body produces enough heat and bioelectricity to fuel many basic functions that nanites can do, but nanites can run on other forms of energy as well. Light and other forms of radiation are all useful (if the host body is properly adapted to it). If the host is in a magical universe, then mana is the best power source there is for nanites, although other magical energies also suffice.

A human mind is filled with desires and fears, whether they be conscious thought or otherwise, these provide all the instruction that nanites require. Just as magic finds a way, nanites do too. With proper training and mental discipline, conscious control of nanites can be achieved, and specific detailed instructions can be provided.

### Theoretically Infinite Power

Ikarus has a habit of doing a lot of crazy shit that should not be possible for anyone who isn't some kind of demigod or demon (He's an angel, honest). In reality, his own greatest feats are far beyond the power that his own body produces, or even that which he can steal from his environment. In reality, he has within himself a number of channels (eight clusters of them, to be specific) that connect to nearby dimensions. These dimensions are flooded with more than enough energy to fuel whatever Ikarus desires. Unfortunately, Ikarus cannot use even 0.01% of the power he could access through these channels, due to the locks placed upon them by Prism.

Do note that the maximum throughput of these channels can also be limited by the nature of the universe or dimension that Ikarus is in at the time. The provided descriptions assume that he is in a Prime Material Plane.

### The Mana Reactor

Even without the energy channels, Ikarus still has a significant power source within himself in the form of the mana reactor. As Ikarus does not have a soul to produce mana for his nanites, and he does not trust Prism to not cut off his energy channels completely at some point, the mana reactor serves as a backup power source. It functions by transmuting matter into mana. While any matter will do, his personal preference is for the stuff that dying stars are made from (which he currently can't get because reasons).

The predecessor to the mana reactor was the omni reactor, which was designed in a universe without magic. It produced electricity and various forms of radiation by splitting apart protons and neutrons and reconstituting the component particles as electrons. The new design is safer, more efficient, and all around better.

### Brain like a Computer

Before Ikarus even existed, before Seth came to be, the Allfather was dissatisfied with his biological brain and had his nanites upgrade him. It wasn't a sudden decision, but rather a slow transition that the Allfather probably wasn't even aware of. The result was a brain that functioned like a computer, and ran his mind in perfect simulation. Not quite an AI, but with some of the benefits.

Ikarus, being a spawn of Seth who was a spawn of the Allfather, inherited this trait and everything that came with it.

Since Ikarus's mind is still biological in nature (even if that nature is simulated), thinking about multiple things at once is still difficult. However, he can think of them significantly faster than most. Because of this, he perceives time in a constant slow-motion. This gives him a significant advantage in combat, but can cause difficulties when trying to pay attention to conversation.

Sure, I have all the time I want to come up with a witty response, but I find it hard to care when everyone talks like an ent.

Outside of Ikarus's conscious mind, he can easily have a number of programs running without him needing to pay any attention to them. While many programs are quite mundane, such as his music player and extranet browser, others control the functions of his nanites. Purely for the sake of familiarity, Ikarus uses these programs much like you use the programs on the computer you're sitting in front of right now. However, instead of a mouse, keyboard, or touchscreen, he uses thought.

Do note that while Ikarus does think faster than normal beings, his ability to come up with new ideas is not enhanced. Yes, he is significantly smarter than the average human, however, he is by no means a genius.

These properties cause Ikarus to be resistant to things like fear, as well as anything that induces sleep. Magical illusions that effect the mind rather than the light or sound in an area are effectively invisible to Ikarus, unless specifically tailored to someone like him.

### Mechanical Anatomy

Just like Ikarus's brain is like a computer, the rest of him is very much like a machine. While this does lend to an improvement in strength, dexterity, and constitution when compared to peak human physiology, Ikarus relies on other abilities to go beyond that. The main benefits of mechanical anatomy include an immunity to aging, and not needing to do things like eat or breathe (He can eat, and loves breakfast food, but he doesn't need to). Most poisons are innefective, and many injuries that would be fatal to humans can be outright ignored while being repaired by nanites. Do note that Ikarus is not in any way immune to pain (disabling pain receptors would slow down reaction times).

### Gravity Manipulation

Ikarus is able to influence gravity in small scales. While he typically uses this ability to simulate telekinesis (which grants a number of benefits), it is primarily limited by range. It's full effect can only be used on objects he is physically touching, while being only half as effective on objects within one meter of him. Outside a range of one hundred meters, it would take a massive expenditure of energy to move a paperclip. Ikarus can routinely and easily lift about one ton of matter, but his upper limits are restricted only by available power. If he burns all accumulated reserves (assuming that the energy channels are restricted as usual), he can lift up to one thousand tons for an extremely brief period of time (less than a minute).

Ikarus also uses gravity manipulation to help move himself rapidly over short distances. Due to a limitation in the technology, he cannot propel himself faster than the speed of sound when in atmosphere, but that's still faster than most sentient beings can react. In the vacuum of space, he can accelerate to 99% the speed of light in about a minute.

Ikarus also uses gravity manipulation to protect himself from physical harm. (I haven't done any kind of math to figure out how effective this is yet.) Of course, this defense only works if Ikarus knows an attack is coming.

Not to be confused with Gravity Weapons, which are a devastatingly powerful class of Forbidden Weapons that Ikarus does not have access to. More on those in its own document.

### Energy Manipulation

Energy manipulation is fucking cool.

There's a lot of offensive, defensive, and utility uses for this shit.

*information needed*

Which leads directly into:

### Plasma Weapons

Ikarus uses a form of blue colored plasma for most of his weapons.

*information needed*

### Cryozyme

*information needed*

### Matter Manipulation / Fabrication

*information needed*

### Special Techniques

Ikarus has a number of abilities made possible by combining energy manipulation with matter fabrication, especially when applied to himself.

Teleportation: By creating a small wormhole of sorts, Ikarus can cross great distances without needing to travel the space inbetween. Unlike magical teleportation, Ikarus is able to take unwilling creatures with him, however he is limited in what he can move. This form of teleportation can only move things if Ikarus is touching them, and if everything Ikarus is trying to teleport fits within a three meter (diameter) sphere.

Task-Specific Gadgets: Sometimes, Ikarus doesn't have a function prepared for a situation. When this happens, he'll need to make something to serve the purpose. *information needed*

### Avatar System

TLDR: Remote control bodies.

Wait, what?

Ikarus never leaves his ship. He can't. If anything, he is his ship. This is so that even if the worst happens, it doesn't matter. These remote control bodies carry a lesser energy channel connecting them to Ikarus, which transmit both power Ikarus's direct control. Ikarus can only control one body at a time, but he can rapidly change focus from one body to another and leave them with (extremely basic) instructions for the onboard autonomy to follow. So long as the universe or dimension that Ikarus's current body is in is nearby to the universe or dimension that his ship is in, then no interruption of control will occur.

But, doesn't that mean all the above information is wrong?!?!?

No, the ship has its own attributes.

## The Daedalus

### The Ikarus Core

The "real body" of Ikarus is a sphere eight meters in diameter which houses his mana reactor, energy channels, brain, and other vital functions. This sphere is coated in a one meter thick layer of Octium (an alloy made from eight theoretically indestructible metals). This sphere, called the Ikarus Core, is carried onboard his ship, the Daedalus.

### The Daedalus

Ikarus's ship is a Liset-class personal transport. Originally designed by Prism to be a home away from home for Shadesmith family members, Ikarus has heavily modified this one to suit his needs. While it doesn't carry any armaments per se, it does carry Ikarus's remote control bodies, which are weapons enough. If The Daedalus is ever threatened, it will either teleport to a distant location, or jump to a nearby parallel dimension.

## Important questions carried over from the Q&A because I haven't figured out how to incorporate the answers in the above document yet

### What is Ikarus's maximum destructive capability, on his own power alone?

To answer this, we are going to consider only the power output of Ikarus's mana reactor, channeled through his plasma weapons. No energy channels, no power stolen from the environment. There are still two ways that the question can be answered:

There are still two ways that the question can be answered.

1: If Ikarus burned all reserve energy all at once, how much could he destroy?

2: If Ikarus burned energy at the rate at which he generated it, how much could he continuously destroy over time?

The answers are as follows:

1: Probably something the size of a small moon, maybe larger if given enough prep time.

2: A large city roughly every hour.

### How connected is he to his "brothers"? Do they know everything he is experiencing, or do they only get incomplete fragments? If they can do either of these things, how easy is it to "get in touch"?

Hardly connected at all, well, most of the time. It is completely normal to send/receive no information whatsoever for years (even decades) at a time. Shadesmiths in general (and Ikarus in particular) lead very personal and self-absorbed lives, without feeling the need to keep each other up to date on all the mundane details. This is not to say that they don't enjoy each other's company, they just don't actively seek it out.

As to how difficult it is to get in contact with another Shadesmith, it's about the same as making a phone call. All the "hardware" is internalized, and the signals are carried over modulated gravity waves through one of many parallel dimensions with properties ideal for the function. The "Psychic Link Communication Protocol" features a dynamic encryption system protecting connections from eavesdroppers, as well as a maximum data throughput of 1YB/sec. This value is of course estimated, as even during extensive testing, no Shadesmith ever managed to use all the available bandwidth. Additional systems are in place to analyze the signal as it's being decrypted to ensure that no malicious content is present (or is suppressed/destroyed if found).

### Has Ikarus ever died before, or been to the "other side"?

While Ikarus has never experienced death firsthand, he has visited a number of netherworlds, heavens, hells, and purgatories.

### Has Ikarus ever made a deal with a nefarious being or been soulbound to any entity? Also, how strong is Ikarus in the eldritch/immaterial sense? How potent is his soul, and how in control of it is he?

Deals have been made, but only to screw over the nefarious. Ikarus has never been soulbound, largely because he doesn't have a soul in the traditional sense. Systems are in place to perform the functions of a soul, but that's not the same thing. This is due not only to the fact that Ikarus is an incomplete fragment of a person, but also due to the nature of the universe he originated from. In a universe that had no magic, there are no souls.

Not having a soul has a number of significant benefits, but it's not all good.

On the plus side, most demons don't know what a mana reactor is. Because of this, Ikarus has cheated many a demon out of favors by agreeing to pay up his own soul after the deed is done, only for the demon to find out that there is no soul to be had. Contracts bound in blood and magic are very particular about the specific wording of things, and you can't lose what you don't have to begin with. This is not to say that Ikarus cannot be "soulbound", just that common demons don't know how to write a contract to take into account Ikarus's unusual nature. Ikarus typically avoids verbal agreements with demons because ambiguity allows magic to find a way, which would really bite him in the ass.

On the down side, souls are fucking delicious to anyone who doesn't have one to call their own. Hell, souls are delicious anyway. Not that Ikarus would know from first hand experience, of course. Seth did something similar (and frequently), and Ikarus carries Seth's memories from before Ikarus existed, so that will always be both haunting and tempting.

Ikarus is able to interact with ghosts as if they had physical form, although not due to his spiritual nature (or lack of spiritual nature). Instead, the energies that Ikarus manipulates and relies on to fuel his nanites make him just as solid to ethereal beings as it would be if he really where the angel he frequently claims to be.

### If Ikarus's soul/essence was tampered with in any way, would any of his family know, regardless of direct contact being made?

Short answer: No. Not even Prism will suspect a thing until contact is reestablished.

## Terminology that should have it's own page but doesn't yet:

End War: The final (unwritten) book of the Chaos is Eternal: Origin series. It's the story of the events leading up to how the Shadesmith family's home universe was utterly and literally destroyed. In the End War story, there where two major sides: Seth, and everyone else.

Allfather: Not to be confused with Odin Allfather, King of Gods for the Second Pantheon of Erewhon. In this context, Allfather refers to Glitch Daracova [character], the man responsible for starting the Shadesmith Family. After End War, no one speaks the name Glitch Daracova. Some things were best left forgotten.

Shadesmith Brothers and Shadesmith Family: The Shadesmith Brothers are eight individuals, direct sons of the Allfather, who officially started the Shadesmith Family. Other people have been brought into the Shadesmith Family over time, but there have only ever been eight Shadesmith Brothers.
