# History of Erewhon: The Fourth Pantheon

Originally posted November 11th, 2015.

_ The gods of the fourth pantheon are many and varied, just as the gods that came before them. Each where shaped by the wills of their followers, and each influence the worlds to reflect those beliefs. As the gods are far to numerous to describe them all, only information on the most notable deities is provided here.

_ Possibly the most widely known deity of Erewhon is Vikandis, God of the Sun and King of Gods. He stands for law and justice, and is the patron deity of most of Erewhon.

_ Agrella, also known as Persephone in some regions, is the goddess of life and virtue. She is the wife of Vikandis. The continent of Agraria is named such in her honor (or did she pick up the name from the continent? beliefs that change the worlds interfere with tracking history).

_ Krypta and Charnel are the twin gods of death.

_ As Goddess of the Underworld, Krypta stands for order and balance. She is responsible for judging the souls of the dead, and sending them to whatever eternity they deserve from the life they just finished.

_ Charnel on the other hand, is much more interested in the dying part of death. Contrary to popular belief, he does not want to destroy the worlds, as that is where all the best suffering happens. Charnel’s followers dedicate themselves to ending life in the most excruciating ways possible, as the pain of mortals (believer or not) make him stronger.

_ Luna/Lunnord is the androgynous deity of the moon and the wind. S/he stands for knowledge above all else, and supports many arcane colleges the worlds over. S/he is also the herald of the tempest, as her/his kindness and anger are as fickle as the weather.

_ James (don’t call him Krolm, he doesn’t like that) is the god of the earth. It’s not all dirt and rocks, just mostly. All precious gems and metals are also his domain and any who want to acquire them should curry his favor. James favors peace above war, and diplomacy to aggression. He is slow to anger, but once his wrath is invoked, the rage of the earth is unrelenting.

_ Ignus. Pyro. The mad god of fire. Many call him a god of destruction, but that is not entirely true. He represents the spark of imagination, the engine of industry, and the bearer of light. He inspires many things in many people, for both good and ill. As is the way of fire, he hungers for power and seeks to dominate all the worlds.

_ The god of monsters has many names, none of which can be pronounced by the likes of men. Little of him is known by the civilized world, but he is feared as the terror of the night. He thrives on the nightmares of children, and the wars raged by orks and trolls in the wilds.

_ Bahamut. God of all good dragonkind. He is the eldest living god, having survived since the time of the second pantheon (argued by some scholars to be older than that). While the faith of dragons is stronger than the faith of men, there aren’t many dragons left in the lands of Erewhon. He is old and weak compared to his former self, but is still a god and still a force to be reckoned with.

_ In all of history, there are only three mortals who have ever ascended to godhood.

_ One had a lot of help and killed gods to steal their power (causing the Ragnarok that ended the time of the third pantheon). Although his name has been lost to time, he has become the god of war in the fourth pantheon.

_ Another became so rich (through various means) that he simply bribed his way to divinity (“Money can buy followers, so lift me up and I’ll spread the love!”). Maxamillion Goldhammer, the dwarven god of trade and fortune has a hand in nearly every monetary transaction across Erewhon. Merchants pray to him thrice a day for good custom. Kings tithe to his churches from taxes received. He may not be as imposing as other gods, but the rich fear him the most.

_ The third convinced a country to worship him like a deity, and from that built an empire. With enough followers, the spark of divinity was ignited within him, and he became the God Emperor Kaiser Phobos. His history is beyond the scope of this document.
