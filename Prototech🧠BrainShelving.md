# Legal Regulations: Brain Shelving
> Return to: [Prototech⚙️MechanicalAugmentation](Prototech⚙️MechanicalAugmentation.md)

In most jurisdictions where mechanical augmentations are widely used, **brain shelving** has become a **legally sanctioned practice** to manage the consequences of **repossession** when individuals default on their **augmetic loans**. Since repossession of crucial augmetics, such as **limbs** or **vital organs**, would be **crippling or fatal**, the law mandates that individuals must be offered the option of **brain shelving** to pay off their debts.

#### **Brain Shelving and Legal Requirements:**

- **Mandatory Option:** When augmetics are repossessed, the **Brain Shelving Act** (or its equivalent) in many jurisdictions requires that debtors be offered the option of **brain shelving** instead of facing physical incapacitation or death. This ensures that, even after repossession, the individual has a means to **work off their debts** through **shelved computational labor**.
    
- **Legal Shelving Duration:** Most regions impose **legal limits** on the length of time a brain can be shelved, with debt repayment typically structured to ensure that the individual is not **shelved indefinitely**. However, due to **interest rates** and **fees**, some individuals find themselves shelved for **years or even decades** before they can pay off their debts and afford **new augmetics** or a **body reintegration**.
    
- **Ethical Concerns:** While **brain shelving** is legally regulated, it remains a subject of **ethical controversy**. Many argue that the practice constitutes a form of **modern slavery**, where individuals are reduced to tools for corporate profit. **Legal battles** over the rights of shelved individuals—such as their right to **consciousness**, **fair wages**, or **humane treatment**—continue to be a major point of contention.
    
- **Repossession Protocols:** In most jurisdictions, repo crews must **offer brain shelving** before conducting a repossession. In cases where this protocol is violated, companies may face **legal penalties**, although enforcement of these regulations can be inconsistent, especially in **corporate-controlled territories** like **Pluto** or **industrial sectors** of **Terra**.
