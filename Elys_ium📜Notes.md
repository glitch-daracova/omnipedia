Agrella's love may be fickle, but it is easily won. She rewards her followers with gentle rain and bountiful harvests. Illness is rare, but is usually attributed to Agrella's displeasure or to Charnel simply being Charnel. Death is a natural conclusion to life, but Agrella denies Charnell satisfaction by ensuring her followers have a peaceful passing.

No god dares declare war upon James. Minor conflicts are common between the gods of Elys_ium, of course, but all out war would be devastating. James, at any time, can simply take back the land he has allowed the other gods to rule. Or, if he doesn't want it either, he can make it simply fall from the realm and into the Breach where it will be utterly destroyed. James can also bring forth new islands, and will often do so in exchange for favors from the other gods.

Stratos has taken a keen interest in the arcane arts as it means his followers can become the most powerful in Elys_ium (and possibly beyond). His temples often contain schools for magic, with secret libraries available only to devout mages. Despite this, the other gods see Stratos as a load of hot air. A blowhard, convinced of his own superiority but unable to prove it.

Ignus has single-handedly brought Elys_ium into industrial revolution. Of course, starting with his own domain of Pyreborea. Steam and clockwork has allowed Ignus and his followers to compete with Stratos and his wizards. Both seek to expand their domains, nut just within Elys_ium, but beyond.

Charnel's followers are indeed alive, despite him being a god of death. It is the dying part of death he is a god of, not the dead part of death. His followers fear him, their pain and disgust empower him. The meat of the land can be cooked and eaten, but it is a nauseating source of sustenance. A better source of sustenance is creating more misery. Charnel is not liked by the other gods, at best they see him as a necessary part of Elys_ium's metaphysics.

Each island belongs entirely to a god's domain. Islands are not split between domains, but sometimes are contested. The geography of an island will slowly change to match the will of the ruling god. If ownership is taken by another god, then the process begins again.

These five gods have ruled in Elys_ium for uncounted millenia, with no end in sight. Nobody knows what might happen if one were to end.

Each of these gods have established themselves in realms beyond Elys_ium, but their ability to shape the lands is limited exclusively to their home realm. Some of them are worshiped abroad due to natural consequence, others because they actively desire to expand their domains.
