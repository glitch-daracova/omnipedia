#### Origins: The Reluctant Shepherd of Souls

Nolan Grimm was not always a god of punishment and torment. In his earliest incarnation, he was the **god of death**, tasked with guiding the souls of the deceased to their final rest and safeguarding travelers on perilous journeys. While others saw his role as noble or necessary, Nolan saw it as **thankless drudgery**. Mortals cursed his name in their grief, the living feared his presence, and his divine peers dismissed him as a grim necessity, unworthy of admiration or respect.

The **sky god**, a deity of radiance and vitality, had thrust this role upon Nolan, framing it as an honor. In truth, it was a burden‚Äîa mantle no other god wanted. Nolan, bound by duty and divine hierarchy, accepted his station, but resentment grew like a shadow in his heart.

#### Betrayal and Disillusionment

The turning point came in the form of repeated **betrayals**. The sky god, whose influence overshadowed Nolan‚Äôs, would call upon him for aid only to **take the credit for victories** and **cast blame for failures**. Mortal emissaries would pray to the sky god for deliverance while cursing Nolan for their unavoidable deaths. Time and again, Nolan was made the scapegoat, his sacrifices forgotten or scorned.

His disdain for the living deepened. He had never liked them‚Äîtheir fleeting lives, their selfish prayers, their inability to see beyond their immediate needs. He fulfilled his duties not out of compassion, but out of obligation. Yet, as the centuries passed, even obligation wore thin. Nolan came to see his role not as a divine calling, but as a **cosmic joke at his expense**.

#### Leroy‚Äôs Rebellion

When **Leroy Tyrannus** rose against the old gods of Noct_yr, Nolan saw an opportunity to break free from his chains. Leroy‚Äôs ambition, charisma, and sheer force of will were undeniable. More importantly, Leroy **recognized Nolan‚Äôs worth**. Unlike the sky god, Leroy valued what Nolan could offer‚Äîan ironclad enforcer, a god who could inspire terror and loyalty in equal measure.

For the first time in his existence, Nolan felt truly **seen and appreciated**. He joined Leroy‚Äôs rebellion without hesitation, casting aside his old duties and turning his powers of death to new purposes: **torment and damnation**. Together, they overthrew the old gods, and Nolan claimed his rightful place in **House Athetos** as **"The Hand"**, the enforcer of Leroy‚Äôs will.

#### A God of Punishment

Now free from the constraints of his old role, Nolan has embraced his true nature. He no longer serves as a passive guide for the dead; he is a **god of punishment**, a **lord of torment**, wielding his powers to break the spirits of the living and ensure the loyalty of the dead. His dominion over **Noct_ium**, the underworld of Noct_yr, allows him to command legions of undead and demon mercenaries, enforcing House Athetos‚Äô rule across realms.

- **Torment**: Nolan inflicts suffering with meticulous precision, finding satisfaction in the artistry of pain and fear.
- **Damnation**: He condemns souls to eternal servitude or obliteration, ensuring that none escape the consequences of defying House Athetos.

#### Loyalty to Leroy

Nolan‚Äôs loyalty to Leroy is absolute‚Äînot out of subservience, but out of respect. For the first time, Nolan feels that his efforts are **valued**. Leroy‚Äôs appreciation for his work gives him purpose, and Nolan is fiercely protective of his god king‚Äôs vision.

- **Strengths**: Nolan‚Äôs strategic brilliance and mastery of death make him a vital asset to House Athetos. His ability to inspire fear ensures that few dare to oppose the pantheon.
- **Weaknesses**: His hatred of the living can cloud his judgment, leading him to act out of spite rather than strategy.

#### Legacy and Influence

Nolan Grimm‚Äôs transformation from a reluctant shepherd of souls to a god of torment reflects the bitter undercurrent of **House Athetos‚Äô philosophy**: that power is earned through struggle, and respect is reserved for those who take it. In **Noct_ium**, his presence is absolute, his wrath unavoidable. To the living, he is a nightmare; to the dead, a tyrant; but to Leroy Tyrannus, he is a trusted and indispensable ally‚Äîthe unyielding **Hand of the God King**.
