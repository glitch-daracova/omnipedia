### A History of Survival and Resilience

Located in the **Sigma Draconis system within Material Reality**, **New Earth** is a world born from the perseverance of human colonists who embarked on a dangerous and ultimately tragic journey from **Terra** in the **Sol System**. The arrival of these pioneers set the foundation for a new human civilization, marked by both loss and resilience, as generations fought to survive, rebuild, and thrive in a foreign star system. Today, New Earth stands as a technologically advanced society and the central hub of ORDER’s operations.

#### The Great Ark and the Voyage from Terra

The colonization of New Earth began thousands of years ago, during an era known as **Terra’s Second Renaissance**, when humanity embarked on ambitious voyages to settle other stars. The settlers left Terra aboard a **generation ship known as the Ark**, designed for an unprecedented journey through the Breach. Although breachtravel had only recently been theorized, the technology to make it remotely safe—the **Vargas Field**—would not be invented for centuries, leaving the Ark’s crew vulnerable to the unknown perils of inter-realm space.

The journey quickly descended into chaos:

- **Lost Communication and System Failures**: Contact with Terra was lost as soon as the Ark entered the Breach, leaving the colonists isolated in a realm-shifting journey that subjected them to strange temporal distortions and spatial anomalies.
- **Psychological Instability**: Without the protection of a Vargas Field, half the crew succumbed to **madness and homicidal rage**, as the Breachfire and environmental instability affected both minds and systems. This resulted in deadly conflicts, fear, and a profound erosion of trust and order.
- **Generational Knowledge Loss**: Over successive generations, the colonists lost much of their scientific knowledge and technological skills, leaving them with only fragments of their original mission. The remaining colonists clung to survival, and as systems degraded, they preserved what knowledge they could, passing it down like oral tradition in the hope it would be enough to guide future generations.

#### Arrival at Sigma Draconis and the Founding of New Earth

After untold hardships, the Ark finally reached **Sigma Draconis**. By then, **nearly every system on the Ark was either malfunctioning or irreparably damaged**, resulting in a crash landing on the surface of New Earth. For the survivors, the crash marked both the end of a nightmare and the beginning of a monumental challenge:

- **Emergence from the Wreckage**: The colonists who survived crawled from the Ark’s wreckage, free from the madness of the Breach but left with only the remnants of their ancient knowledge. Against the odds, they began to rebuild, finding ways to adapt to the planet’s unfamiliar environment and surviving on limited resources.
- **Early Settlement and Reconstruction**: These first colonists laid the foundation for a new society. Much of their knowledge had devolved, but they used what skills and fragments they could to develop an agricultural base and basic infrastructure. Slowly, a new human civilization emerged, drawing from legends of Terra and stories passed down through the generations.

#### New Earth’s Development Over Millennia

In the thousands of years following their arrival, the people of New Earth achieved significant advancements, progressing from survivalist beginnings to a level of society and technology that mirrored **21st-century Terra**. Their journey from settlers to a flourishing civilization was marked by cultural development, innovation, and a growing sense of identity rooted in their past struggles.

- **Cultural Identity and Unity**: While the memory of Terra faded, the story of the Ark became central to New Earth’s identity. Generations honored their ancestors’ resilience, and the tales of the journey became mythic, reinforcing a cultural sense of survival, unity, and connection to their ancient home.
- **Technological Evolution**: Without the immediate support or knowledge base of Terra, New Earth’s people reinvented technology at their own pace. By the time of ORDER’s founding, New Earth had achieved technological and cultural progress equivalent to a **21st-century Terran society**. They had developed infrastructure, communication systems, and basic industrialization but lacked the high-speed breachtravel or advanced nanotechnology seen in modern realms.

#### Modern New Earth and the Arrival of ORDER

By the time of ORDER’s establishment, New Earth had become a thriving society, though still under a **constant overcast** due to environmental factors. This cloud cover and the legacy of survivalism made New Earth a place of practical innovation and adaptability, traits that proved vital as ORDER expanded its influence:

- **ORDER’s Founding and the Building of ORDER Tower**: When ORDER arrived on New Earth, its leaders established **ORDER Tower** as the primary headquarters, ushering in a new era of technology and security for New Earth’s inhabitants. ORDER brought with it advanced technology, arcane knowledge, and access to the multiverse, elevating New Earth’s position in Material Reality.
- **Modern Role of New Earth**: Now a central hub for ORDER’s activities, New Earth has become a place of political stability and technological growth. ORDER Tower’s establishment has integrated New Earth into the multiversal landscape, allowing it to serve as a link between realms and a seat of power for ORDER’s vast operations.
