### **Morale**

- **Function**: Morale represents the psychological state of the survivors, including both player characters and NPCs. It can be spent to improve certain rolls (e.g., combat, hacking, repairs) or to mitigate negative consequences (e.g., preventing a panic, reducing the impact of a crisis).
- **Usage**:
    - **Boosting Rolls**: Spend Morale to add a bonus to a roll, representing the survivors’ determination and willpower.
    - **Mitigating Consequences**: Spend Morale to lessen the impact of a negative event, such as preventing an injury or calming a panicking NPC.
- **Regeneration**: Morale can be restored by achieving small victories, finding safe zones, receiving good news, or through certain characters’ abilities (e.g., a rousing speech by a charismatic leader).
- **Low Morale Effects**:
    - When Morale drops below a certain threshold, survivors may begin to act erratically, refusing orders, panicking, or even becoming hostile.
    - Negative events might also become more likely, as the general despair of the group starts to manifest in bad decisions and increased danger.

### **Supply**

- **Function**: Supplies represent the food, water, and medicine necessary for survival.
- **Consumption**:
    - **Routine Use**: Every survivor (player and non-player) consumes 1 Supply every 8 in-game hours.
    - **Healing**: Injured or sick survivors can consume additional Supplies to heal (1 Supply per healing action). The healing effect is more potent if Cool Breeze is involved, representing her ability to make the most out of limited resources.
- **Scarcity**:
    - Supplies will be a critical resource to manage, as their scarcity will push players to make tough decisions about who gets what and when.
    - Finding additional Supplies will be a key objective, forcing players to explore dangerous areas of the station.

### **Ammo**

- **Function**: Ammo is a limited resource representing the total amount of ammunition available for all weapons.
- **Usage**:
    - **Weapon Costs**: Each weapon has an ammo cost per use, reflecting the type of weapon and its efficiency. For example:
        - **Handgun**: 1 Ammo per shot.
        - **Rifle**: 2 Ammo per shot.
        - **Shotgun**: 3 Ammo per shot (higher spread and damage).
    - **Generic Ammo**: For simplicity, all weapons use the same generic Ammo pool. This encourages strategic thinking about which weapons to use and when.
- **Management**: Players must carefully manage their Ammo, deciding when to fight and when to avoid combat. Running out of Ammo could mean disaster in a critical moment.

### **Air**

- **Function**: Air represents the breathable atmosphere within the station. Maintaining the life support system is crucial to survival.
- **Usage**:
    - **Normal Operation**: If the life support system is functioning, Air stays at maximum.
    - **Life Support Failure**: If life support is down, Air decreases by 1 unit per living survivor every hour.
    - **Air Depletion**:
        - **Non-Player Survivors**: When Air reaches zero, non-player survivors begin to die off, with half perishing every hour until life support is restored or all are dead.
        - **Player Survivors**: Player characters have a personal air supply that activates when station Air runs out. This supply will sustain them temporarily, but if it depletes, the player character will die.
- **Vacuum Situations**: The personal air supply is also used when outside the station or in vacuum conditions, emphasizing the importance of maintaining and monitoring this resource.

### **Survivors**

- **Function**: NPC survivors can contribute to various tasks but are also a drain on resources.
- **Usage**:
    - **Tasks**: Non-player survivors can be assigned to basic tasks such as monitoring systems, gathering supplies, or assisting in minor repairs. They are not as skilled as player characters but can be helpful.
    - **Resource Drain**:
        - **Supply Consumption**: Non-player survivors consume Supplies every 8 hours, just like player characters.
        - **Air Consumption**: They also consume Air, adding to the urgency of keeping the life support system operational.
- **Scoring**:
    - **Endgame Scoring**: The number of non-player survivors successfully rescued and evacuated at the end of the game contributes to the players' final score. More survivors saved equals a higher score.
    - **Moral Dilemma**: Players may face tough choices about who to save, who to risk in dangerous situations, and how much they’re willing to sacrifice to keep NPC survivors alive.

### **Gameplay Implications**

- **Strategic Balance**: Players will need to balance short-term survival (managing Ammo, Air, and Supplies) with long-term success (maintaining Morale, rescuing survivors).
- **Resource Scarcity**: The limited nature of these resources will create tension, forcing players to make difficult decisions and prioritize certain actions over others.
- **Dynamic Challenges**: As crises emerge (e.g., life support failure, Ammo shortages), players must adapt their strategies to manage their resources effectively.
- **Moral and Ethical Decisions**: The management of non-player survivors introduces ethical dilemmas, adding depth to the gameplay and encouraging role-playing.
