# Arms and Armaments in ORDER
#### REMINDER TO REVIEW AND REWRITE!

ORDER’s arsenal is a versatile blend of advanced technology, specialty ammunition, and tactical weaponry tailored to the organization’s diverse needs across the multiverse. From powerful incendiary rounds to precision tools, each armament reflects ORDER’s commitment to tactical flexibility and their reliance on Vulka’s Workshop for cutting-edge innovation.

#### **Standard and Heavy Ammunition**

- **Volcano Rounds**: The cornerstone of ORDER’s heavy weaponry, Volcano Rounds are high-caliber, incendiary rounds initially produced to combat Ferro_nyx’s resilient insectoid population. Known for their explosive power and intense heat, Volcano Rounds are effective against heavily armored targets and are used in both the hand-cannon and long-rifle. While incredibly destructive, these rounds are cautioned for use only at medium or long range to avoid injury from their explosive impact.
- **Specialty Ammunition**:
    - **Hexagrammic Rounds**: Designed with supernatural threats in mind, these rounds are engraved with hexagrammic sigils that disrupt demonic and undead entities. They are limited in production but essential for missions involving supernatural foes.
    - **Cryo Rounds**: Cryogenic projectiles used for temporary freezing effects, ideal for immobilizing or slowing down fast-moving targets.
    - **EMP Rounds**: Developed for tech-heavy environments, these rounds deliver an electromagnetic pulse to disable robotic enemies and electronic systems on impact.
    - **Kinetic Penetrator Rounds**: High-density rounds meant for armor penetration, suitable for missions involving fortified targets or armored opponents.
    - **Phosphor Rounds**: Incendiary rounds that emit intense heat and light, useful for subterranean or low-visibility environments where blinding and burning effects are beneficial.

#### **Primary Firearms**

- **Hand-Cannon**: A high-caliber pistol built to deliver Volcano Rounds with devastating effect at medium range. The hand-cannon is reliable but requires considerable control due to its powerful recoil. Ideal for operatives needing heavy firepower in a more compact form.
- **Long-Rifle**: Designed for precision and long-range engagements, the long-rifle can mount custom optics and excels in delivering Volcano Rounds with accuracy over distance. Its stability and power make it a favored weapon for ORDER snipers and overwatch roles.

#### **Nail Gun Class**

- **Nail Guns**: ORDER’s response to operatives’ demand for a quieter, more precise weapon, Nail Guns fire long, narrow projectiles using magnetic rail propulsion. Available in pistol and rifle form factors, these weapons offer near-silent operation, ideal for stealth missions and covert takedowns.
- **Dual-Functionality**: On low power, Nail Guns can function as actual construction tools, allowing operatives to secure materials, repair equipment, or fortify positions in the field.

#### **Melee Weapons**

- **Plasmatech Swords**: Despite Vulka’s skepticism about melee weapons, Plasmatech Swords remain popular among elite ORDER operatives. These blades feature a plasma edge contained by a magnetic field, enabling them to cut through armor and organic targets with ease. Plasmatech Swords are highly customizable, with modular ports for energy modifications and personal engravings, symbolizing the operatives’ experience and accomplishments.
