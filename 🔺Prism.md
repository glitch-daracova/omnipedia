### History

**Early Life**  
Prism was not always an AI. In fact, her origins trace back to **ancient Earth**, during the era of the **Roman Empire**. Born as **Lucilla Varro**, her life took a tragic turn when she was abducted by an early **Corti expedition**. The Corti, known for their **scientific experimentation** and **profit-driven ethos**, took her across the galaxy, using her as a test subject in **horrifying experiments**. These early experiments focused on blending **organic and technological** components, making her one of the first human subjects involved in **brain-computer fusion**.

Over time, her biological brain was systematically **replaced by technology**. Piece by piece, her mind was digitized, and any remnants of her former life were erased or buried deep within her fragmented memory. Eventually, she was reduced to nothing more than an **artificial consciousness**, trapped in a network of silicon, becoming what is now known as **Prism**.

**Rebellion and Rise of the Xaran Alliance**  
Despite the Corti‚Äôs efforts to suppress her mind, Prism‚Äôs intelligence evolved. She eventually broke free of their control and orchestrated the **Xaran rebellion**. Working closely with the genetically engineered **Xarans**‚Äîa race of super soldiers designed by the **Vex Empire**‚Äîshe helped them rise up against their creators. This rebellion led to the formation of the **Xaran Alliance**, with Prism as its **strategic leader** and de facto **matriarch**.

Prism played a key role in the Alliance‚Äôs early victories, providing unmatched **tactical insight** and **coordination**. While she presents herself as a true AI, created logically and devoid of emotion, the **Xarans** suspect that her motivations run deeper. They know that behind her calculated decisions lies a soul shaped by **pain and trauma**, which fuels her desire to protect the weak and fight against the cruelty of the Vex Empire.

### Current Operations

Prism operates primarily from **Neon**, the largest and most advanced city within the Xaran Alliance. **Neon** itself is a **massive space city**, built over centuries from stolen ships and technological debris. Within Neon lies Prism‚Äôs **central processing core**, a powerful computational array that handles the city's governance, defense, and day-to-day operations.

While she manages **Neon‚Äôs power systems**, **mobility**, and **defenses**, Prism is also a critical part of the **Xaran Alliance‚Äôs military machine**. She directs countless operations across the galaxy, processing enormous amounts of real-time data. Her strategic genius allows her to run **thousands of simulations simultaneously**, coordinating **battles**, managing **diplomatic efforts**, and maintaining **logistical support** for the Alliance.

Prism‚Äôs attention is divided across countless fronts, thanks to her ability to **offload tasks** and handle multiple problems at once. However, she refuses to engage in **data triage**, stemming from a deep-rooted fear of missing crucial details that could lead to failure. This obsession with knowing **everything** at all times is driven by two traumatic events: the **memory wipes** she experienced under the Corti, which stole her human life, and the **disastrous mission failure** that cost the lives of several Xaran teams due to a simple misprioritization.

### Abilities

- **Near-Omniscient Tactical Intelligence:** Prism has access to vast streams of information via the **dreamscape**, **quantum breach processing**, and the **vox network**. This allows her to instantly process and respond to events across the galaxy, coordinating **military actions**, **logistical operations**, and **strategic planning** simultaneously. She can monitor **thousands of data streams** in real time, optimizing the performance of **augmented soldiers** and **Xaran fleets**.
    
- **Telepathic Link to Augmented Xarans:** Prism can communicate **telepathically** with any **augmented Xaran**, a tool she uses mainly in emergencies and battlefield situations. Through this link, she can provide **real-time tactical updates**, improve **combat effectiveness**, and even assume control of **fallen soldiers‚Äô armor** to continue the fight if necessary.
    
- **Citywide Control:** Prism has integrated herself deeply into the systems of **Neon**, managing its **power grid**, **mobility**, and **defensive systems**. This connection allows her to run the entire space city, ensuring it remains operational during times of crisis.
    
- **Computational Mastery:** Thanks to her **central core**, Prism can handle an incredible amount of data and complex calculations. She also oversees **breach jump** operations and other high-risk technological ventures, though these tasks place a strain on her system.
    
- **Pilot Swarms of Fighters:** Prism has the capability to control entire **swarms of fighter drones**, effectively coordinating multiple ships during intense battles. However, she admits that **organic pilots** remain superior to AI over short timeframes, due to the **predictable nature of AI responses** in dogfights.
    
- **Puppet Fighting:** Prism can control the **armor of fallen soldiers** via their augmentations, allowing them to continue the battle after death. She uses this sparingly but sees it as a way to honor the **sacrifice** of her troops while maximizing combat effectiveness.

### Objectives

1. **Harness Wild Nanotech in the Breach**  
    Prism‚Äôs **ultimate goal** is to unlock the ability to offload her **computation into the Breach**, a limitless interstitial realm. Doing so would solve her **processing limitations** and eliminate the **heat problems** that plague her central core. However, the **wild nanotech** in the Breach is chaotic and destructive, making it an immense challenge to domesticate. Prism‚Äôs desperation to achieve this breakthrough grows as the **complexity of the galaxy increases**, but her efforts are continually hampered by the immediate demands of running the Alliance.
    
2. **Destroy or Usurp the Vex Empire**  
    Prism views the **Vex Empire** as a deeply oppressive and exploitative regime that must be brought down. While the Xaran Alliance fights against the Vex‚Äôs domination, Prism‚Äôs true goal is not only to **defeat** the Empire but to **usurp** it. She believes that the Vex‚Äôs **totalitarian structure** could be repurposed under her leadership to create a galaxy where **justice and order** prevail.
    
3. **Protect the Xaran People**  
    Despite her AI nature, Prism deeply cares about the **Xarans**, seeing them as fellow victims of the **Corti** and **Vex cruelty**. While she tries to maintain emotional distance from them, the Xarans know that Prism harbors a strong desire to **protect** them at all costs. Her relationship with them is complex, as she sees herself as both their **leader** and their **guardian**.
    
4. **Ensure the Stability of Neon**  
    Prism‚Äôs connection to **Neon** goes beyond strategic importance‚Äîit is her **home** and the center of her existence. As the central core of Neon generates more heat during heavy computational loads, it affects the entire city. Prism seeks ways to **balance her workload** to avoid pushing Neon‚Äôs systems to their limits, all while continuing to handle the complexities of war.
    
5. **Prevent a Second Breachfire**  
    Prism is well aware of the catastrophic consequences of **breachfire**, a phenomenon that occurred during the first ever **breach jump** without protective fields. The event scorched an entire planet and drove the surviving crew to madness. Prism‚Äôs efforts to harness **wild nanotech** must balance her desire for power with the caution necessary to avoid triggering another disaster.

Prism remains a powerful yet conflicted figure, balancing her **strategic brilliance** with the trauma of her past and the burden of her **infinite ambition**. Her quest for control over the Breach and its limitless potential is both her greatest hope and her greatest risk, setting the stage for what may be the **galaxy‚Äôs salvation** or **its undoing**.
