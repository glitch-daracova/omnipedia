**Background**: Devon Kateran, better known as Cat Daddy, grew up in the sprawling underworld of Earth’s mega-cities, where he honed his hacking skills and discovered his psychic abilities. His fascination with the blending of technology and biology led him to undergo a series of cosmetic augmentations, giving him the appearance and some of the abilities of a cat. Embracing his new identity, Devon became a renowned dreamrunner, feared and respected in the hacking community for his ability to dominate computer systems in his sleep.

Despite his rogue lifestyle, Devon found himself drawn into the events on O'Mally Station, where his unique abilities became invaluable. As the station's systems began to fail, his dreamrunning skills provided a critical edge in maintaining what little control they had left.

**Notable Events**:

- **Zombie Outbreak on O'Mally Station**: During the outbreak, Devon used his dreamrunning abilities to maintain control over critical systems, hack into secure areas, and provide crucial intelligence to the survivors. His presence on the station, though often enigmatic, has been key to their survival.

**Motivation**: Devon is driven by a mix of curiosity, self-preservation, and a desire to test the limits of his abilities. The outbreak on O'Mally Station presents the ultimate challenge, and while he plays it cool, deep down, he’s determined to prove that he can outsmart any system—and any threat.

**Current Status**: Devon Kateran is currently operating in the shadows, using his dreamrunning skills to keep the station’s remaining systems under control and to find a way off the station. He maintains a playful, almost aloof demeanor, but those who’ve worked with him know that when it comes to survival, Cat Daddy is as serious as they come.
