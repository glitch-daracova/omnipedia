The Anomalous Artifact (which is getting tiring to type, so I'll shorten it to AA in my input) was designed by super-intelligences claiming to be gods that live in the dreamscape. Schematics for it were given to a Vexian prophet by said "gods". Building the AA required the use of a Universal Constructor, a machine also designed by "gods" and built by Corti engineers in the waking world. the AA reacts to compatible biology by spawning nanites, which are able to live within and augment said compatible biology. Some humans (about 1 in 100), and rarely other sentient species (about 1 in 1000) are compatible.

Nanite augmentation, when the biology is compatible, is a seamless process. Nanites are not inherently intelligent, but the seem to "know" how to best keep their host alive. They are able to react to the mind of the host, although usually only on a subconscious level. If the host is a dreamer, then they will begin to manifest abilities and augmentations that are reminiscent of their dreamscape self. Nanites will not inherently integrate with non-compatible biology. If nanites are forced into a host that is not compatible, they will behave like an aggressive auto-immune disease. Depending on the exposure, death may be slow and panful, or swift and painful.

In modern fiction, immortality is often depicted as both a blessing and a curse. I see no reason why it would be different in my setting. For the Xarans, who live short lives compared to humans, this is even more so.

ChatGPT

![[bin/AI.webp|100]]  
**ChatGPT**

Absolutely, the dual nature of immortality can add a profound layer of complexity and depth to your narrative. Here’s how you might explore this theme for the different races, particularly the Xarans:

### **Immortality as a Blessing and a Curse:**

### **Xarans:**

1. **Cultural Impact:**
    
    - **Short Lifespan:** Xarans, who naturally have shorter lifespans than humans, view immortality as a profound change. This gift extends their lives far beyond what their culture has traditionally known.
    - **Societal Roles:** Immortal Xarans might struggle with their place in society. Traditionally, older Xarans would pass on knowledge and leadership roles to younger generations. With immortality, this dynamic shifts significantly.
2. **Emotional and Psychological Struggles:**
    
    - **Longevity vs. Tradition:** Immortal Xarans might find it difficult to adapt to the prolonged lifespan, clashing with cultural norms and expectations. They could feel out of place as they outlive family, friends, and even societal structures.

### **Anomalous Artifact:**

## **1. Physical Description:**

- The Anomalous Artifact is a black cube, precisely 0.3302 meters (approximately 13 inches) on each side. Each face of the cube ripples with intricate silicon circuits, which are in a state of constant flux, rerouting and changing their paths. The circuit traces glow in various colors, creating a mesmerizing, ever-changing pattern, and cast ambient light around the Artifact, creating an otherworldly aura.
    - _Question:_ What specific functions or states do the different colors of the glowing circuits represent?

## **2. Origins and Creation:**

- The Anomalous Artifact was designed by super-intelligences claiming to be gods that reside in the dreamscape. The schematics for the Artifact were given to a Vexian prophet by these "gods." Building the Anomalous Artifact required the use of a Universal Constructor, a machine also designed by these gods and built by Corti engineers in the waking world.
    - _Question:_ What challenges did the Corti engineers face in building the Universal Constructor, and how did they overcome them?

## **3. Functionality and Effects:**

- The Anomalous Artifact generates nanites that integrate with compatible biology, enhancing the hosts with superior augmentations. The nanites can live within and augment compatible biology seamlessly. They are not inherently intelligent but seem to "know" how to best keep their host alive, reacting to the host’s mind, usually on a subconscious level. If the host is a dreamer, the nanites manifest abilities and augmentations reminiscent of their dreamscape self.
    - _Question:_ How do the nanites determine compatibility with a host, and is there a way to increase compatibility artificially?

## **4. Compatibility and Risks:**

- The nanites will not integrate with non-compatible biology. If nanites are forced into a non-compatible host, they behave like an aggressive autoimmune disease, leading to slow or swift and painful death, depending on the exposure.
    - _Question:_ Are there any known cases where non-compatible hosts survived the integration process, and if so, how?

## **5. Historical Impact:**

- While it existed, the Anomalous Artifact was a central figure in myths and legends, revered and feared for its power. It symbolized immense power and influence, leading to wars and alliances formed around it. The destruction of the Anomalous Artifact released a cloud of super-powered nanites over a lightyear distance, creating the first generation immortals.
    - _Question:_ What were some of the most significant wars or alliances formed around the control of the Anomalous Artifact?

## **6. First Generation Immortals:**

- The first generation immortals emerged as a result of the nanite dispersal from the Anomalous Artifact’s destruction. These immortals possess superior augmentations and discover that death is a temporary condition for them. Statistically, some immortals are Vex, some are Corti, some belong to other races of the Empire, some are Xarans, and a few are humans. Glitch, being at the epicenter, was the most affected.
    - _Question:_ How did the emergence of first generation immortals impact the political and social structures of their respective races?

## **7. Transition to Magic:**

- Thousands of years later, as magic pervades the waking world, the understanding of nano-augmentation evolves into what is now perceived as magic. The advanced technology of the Anomalous Artifact and its nanites is mythologized, and people start referring to these abilities as magical.
    - _Question:_ How did different cultures incorporate the concept of magic into their existing belief systems and traditions?

### **The Dreamcatcher:**

## **1. Divine Inspiration:**

- The first dreamcatcher was a divinely inspired machine, whispered into the mind of a man who could almost dream another world. This invention allowed the people of material reality to enter the dreamscape.
    - _Question:_ What was the visionary’s life like before creating the dreamcatcher, and how did this invention change his fate?

## **2. Historical Impact:**

- The invention of the dreamcatcher marked a significant turning point, giving rise to dreamrunning, a new form of exploration and interaction. Over thousands of years, the dreamcatcher became central to myths and legends, with its origins blending into cultural lore.
    - _Question:_ How did different societies initially react to the invention of the dreamcatcher, and what were some key events in its early use?

## **3. Technological and Magical Evolution:**

- As magic became pervasive in the waking world, the understanding and use of the dreamcatcher evolved. What was once seen as advanced technology became perceived as ancient magic. Institutions and guilds formed to study and harness these abilities.
    - _Question:_ How did the transition from seeing the dreamcatcher as technology to viewing it as magic affect its use and study?

## **4. Interaction with the Dreamscape:**

- The dreamcatcher serves as a bridge, allowing people to enter the dreamscape. This interaction with the dreamscape has profound effects, including the influence of dreamscape gods on the waking world.
    - _Question:_ What are some notable events where interactions through the dreamcatcher significantly impacted the material world?

## **5. Arrival of Dreamscape Gods:**

- Thousands of years later, with the pervasive presence of magic, gods from the dreamscape can now enter material reality. This changes the dynamics between the dreamscape and the waking world.
    - _Question:_ How do the dreamscape gods manifest in the material world, and what are their motives and goals?
