Kinetic is basic physical damage, for when an object strikes another object. If a damage type isn't specified, it's probably this. Nothing that exists physically can be immune to kinetic damage. Other common damage types include Heat, Cold and Electric, of these I don't think any need explanation. Toxic damage is an umbrella for anything poisonous or corrosive. This includes acids, venoms, diseases, radiation, and more. Despite wildly varying methods, these are all considered 'toxic'. Because of these wildly varying methods, nothing that exists physically can be totally immune to toxic damage. Instead, there can only be resistances/immunities to specific sources of toxic damage. Psychic damage doesn't hurt physically, it hurts the mind. If a difficult puzzle has ever left your head hurting, you've experienced psychic damage from a mnemonic agent. An image of impossible geometry that kills anyone who looks at it does so with psychic damage. All creatures with a mind, be it organic or digital, are susceptible to psychic damage.

Your list of damage types for a LitRPG is a solid foundation, covering a broad spectrum of physical and non-physical harm. Here are some thoughts and suggestions for each type and potential additions:

### Kinetic

- **Kinetic** damage is a staple in most games, representing physical harm. You've defined it well, making it clear that it's unavoidable for physically existing entities. Consider specifying interactions with armors or shields, which typically reduce kinetic damage.

### Heat, Cold, and Electric

- **Heat**, **Cold**, and **Electric** damage types are well-understood and don't require much elaboration. However, think about adding nuances like:
    - **Heat** could ignite flammable materials or cause overheating in machinery.
    - **Cold** might slow down enemies or freeze liquids.
    - **Electric** could disrupt electronic systems or stun opponents.

### Toxic

- **Toxic** damage is an interesting category, especially with its broad definition. This can lead to varied gameplay:
    - You might introduce detoxification or antidotes as gameplay elements.
    - Consider environmental hazards that cause toxic damage over time.
    - Differentiating between immediate poisons and long-term diseases or radiation could add strategic depth.

### Psychic

- **Psychic** damage is a unique and versatile type. Consider exploring:
    - Mental defenses or psychic shields to counteract this damage.
    - The possibility of psychic damage affecting morale or combat efficiency.
    - Introducing psychic "noise" as a battlefield hazard.

### Potential Additions

To enhance your damage types, consider the following additions:

- **Magical Damage**: Separate from the physical and mental realms, magical damage could bypass some conventional defenses.
- **Light/Dark Damage**: Depending on your world's lore, these could represent purity and corruption, with unique effects on certain creatures or environments.
- **Sonic Damage**: Beyond physical vibrations, sonic damage could disrupt concentration, shatter objects, or cause disorientation.
- **Environmental Damage**: Damage caused by natural or unnatural environments, like being crushed by rocks or falling into a pit of lava.
- **Temporal Damage**: A rare and exotic type, affecting targets by aging them rapidly, slowing them down, or other time-related effects.

When incorporating these damage types, think about how they interact with the world, character abilities, and the mechanics of combat. Balancing their effects and the availability of countermeasures (like resistances or immunities) will be key to creating engaging and strategic gameplay scenarios. Your current setup provides a great base, with room to expand into even more nuanced and interactive combat dynamics.

I'm trying to avoid magical shenanigans in this setting, so no generic "magic damage". I also want to avoid "good energy vs evil energy", as the setting will mostly call for moral ambiguity. Sonic damage is an interesting one, although I'm not sure if it shouldn't just be part of kinetic damage. We should look into that further. Environmental damage makes more sense as a damage source rather than a damage type, as it could hurt in all kinds of ways.

**ChatGPT**

Given your focus on avoiding magical elements and maintaining moral ambiguity, along with your considerations regarding sonic and environmental damage, let's refine these concepts within your setting's framework.

### Sonic Damage

Sonic damage, while it could be argued as a form of kinetic energy due to its nature of causing harm through vibration and sound waves, possesses unique characteristics that justify its distinction:

- **Mechanics and Application**: Sonic damage can bypass traditional physical defenses. While armor might stop a bullet (kinetic damage), it may not protect as well against the concussive force of a sound wave that can cause internal damage or disorientation. This can introduce unique gameplay elements, such as bypassing certain armors or causing unique status effects (e.g., disorientation, stunning).
    
- **Narrative and World-Building Potential**: Sonic weapons or abilities can be rooted in technology or natural phenomena, fitting well into settings that eschew traditional magic. This allows for creative weapon design, like sonic grenades, or natural hazards, such as creatures that emit destructive sonic calls.
    
- **Versatility**: Sonic damage can affect a broad spectrum of scenarios, from shattering objects to interfering with electronic devices, depending on the frequencies used. This can allow for puzzle-solving elements in your game, where players need to use sonic abilities or items strategically.
    

Considering these aspects, treating sonic damage as a distinct category can enrich your game's combat mechanics and world-building, offering diverse gameplay experiences beyond the physical impact of kinetic damage.

### Environmental Damage

You've made a good point about environmental damage being more of a source than a type. It's a versatile concept that encompasses various forms of harm based on the environment itself:

- **Diverse Manifestations**: Environmental damage can manifest as any of the established types (heat, cold, toxic, etc.), depending on the context. For example, a volcanic area might cause heat damage, while a radioactive wasteland inflicts toxic damage.
    
- **Strategic Depth**: Including environmental hazards adds a layer of strategic planning to navigation and combat. Players must prepare for different environments by equipping gear or using skills that mitigate the specific type of damage expected.
    
- **World Interaction**: It encourages interaction with the game world, as players learn to identify and respond to environmental threats. This can lead to more immersive gameplay, where understanding and adapting to the environment becomes crucial for survival.
    

Given your aims for the setting, focusing on these nuanced and technologically or naturally explained damage types, while avoiding overt magical or morally binary elements, can create a rich and engaging game world. It supports a narrative and gameplay environment where strategy, preparation, and understanding of the world's inherent dangers and wonders are key to the player's progression and survival.

You

What are some other damage types I may be missing?

![[bin/AI.webp|100]]
**ChatGPT**

Expanding on your already comprehensive list of damage types and considering your setting's avoidance of magical elements, there are a few additional categories that might enrich your LitRPG's gameplay and world-building. These types can add depth and complexity, encouraging players to strategize and adapt to various threats.

### 1. **Mechanical Damage**

- **Description**: Damage caused by the failure of mechanical systems or the application of mechanical force in a way that isn't purely kinetic. For instance, getting caught in machinery or suffering due to the malfunction of one's armor or prosthetic could fall under this category.
- **Application**: This type of damage could be particularly relevant in settings with advanced technology or steampunk elements, affecting not only characters but equipment and vehicles as well.

### 2. **Chemical Damage**

- **Description**: Similar to toxic damage but more focused on non-organic chemical reactions, such as burns from acids or bases, and the inhalation of harmful gases. While toxic damage covers a broad spectrum, chemical damage narrows down to specific chemical interactions.
- **Application**: Chemical damage can introduce environmental hazards and the need for protective gear or antidotes, offering strategic gameplay elements in areas contaminated with dangerous substances.

### 3. **Radiation Damage**

- **Description**: Although you included radiation under toxic damage, considering it separately could add layers to gameplay, especially in a post-apocalyptic or space-faring setting. Radiation damage can have both immediate and long-term effects, such as sickness or mutations.
- **Application**: This damage type can be used for areas with lingering hazards or as a weapon effect, necessitating specific countermeasures beyond general poison resistance.

### 4. **Energy Drain**

- **Description**: Not necessarily physical or psychic, this damage type targets the stamina or power source of an entity. It can represent the draining of life force, fatigue from extreme exertion, or the depletion of a power source for machinery or magical artifacts (if any minor magic-like elements exist).
- **Application**: It introduces a strategic element where managing one’s energy or power becomes as crucial as managing health, affecting abilities and overall effectiveness in combat or exploration.

### 5. **Biological Damage**

- **Description**: Damage that specifically targets biological functions, differing from poison or disease by focusing on immediate effects like disrupting oxygen absorption, blood coagulation, or inducing allergic reactions.
- **Application**: Could be used to introduce unique hazards in natural environments or as specialized weapons designed to incapacitate rather than kill.

### 6. **Gravitational Damage**

- **Description**: Damage caused by extreme changes in gravity, affecting both internal and external structures. This could include being crushed by intense gravity or the disorientation and internal injury caused by rapid gravitational shifts.
- **Application**: This type could be particularly relevant in sci-fi settings or areas with magical anomalies (if minor magic exists), offering unique environmental challenges or weapon effects.

Including these types of damage in your game can not only diversify the challenges players face but also deepen the lore and immersion of your world. Each type offers unique narrative and mechanical opportunities, encouraging players to prepare for and adapt to a wide range of threats.
