Each Star Wars movie opens with "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away..."
Most warhammer40k works open with "In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war."

I need ideas for some kind of opening tagline, something that is evocative and descriptive of my setting but without using any proper nouns to confuse anyone.

  
For your setting, considering the mix of post-apocalyptic resilience, technological marvels, and societal struggles within megacities, along with the backdrop of ecological and technological disasters, here are a few opening tagline ideas that aim to capture the essence and mood of your world without relying on proper nouns:

1. "In the shadow of forgotten catastrophes, among the steel giants of human defiance, survival is an art painted with the colors of hope and despair."
    
2. "Beyond the ruins of yesterday's world, within the heart of towering sanctuaries, humanity endures, tethered by the thin threads of innovation and rivalry."
    
3. "Where the legacy of apocalypse shapes the crucible of tomorrow, amid the echoes of survival and ambition, the saga of resilience unfolds."
    
4. "In an age where calamity begets ingenuity, beneath the canopy of monolithic citadels, the dance of survival and dominance perpetuates."
    
5. "Through the ashes of ancient disasters, in the labyrinth of colossal havens, the spirit of humanity flickers, defiant and unyielded."
    
6. "Beneath the shadow of towering safeholds, in the wake of bygone devastations, lies a testament to the enduring, conflicted heart of mankind."
    
7. "Amidst the relics of forsaken trials and the bastions of human will, the fabric of existence weaves tales of struggle, triumph, and the quest for legacy."
    
8. "In the embrace of artificial mountains, standing against the tide of past cataclysms, the future of humanity is forgedâ€”with hope, fear, and the will to prevail."
    

For a more universally applicable tagline that can preface various stories within your expansive setting without focusing on specific narratives or themes, consider these succinct, broad-reaching options:

1. "Where yesterday's ruins meet tomorrow's dreams, humanity forges on."
    
2. "Between the ashes of the past and the steel of the future, survival is the universal tale."
    
3. "In a world sculpted by calamity, every spark of life is a story of defiance."
    
4. "Beyond the echoes of collapse, in the shadow of giants, the human saga continues."
    
5. "Amidst the remnants of disaster, within walls of hope, the struggle for tomorrow unfolds."
    
6. "From the depths of despair to the heights of ambition, the journey of survival never ends."
    
7. "Across the landscape of trials, beneath skies of invention, the pulse of humanity beats on."
    
8. "In the crucible of past perils and future promises, every moment is a battle for eternity."
    

These taglines aim to encapsulate the essence of resilience, innovation, and the enduring human spirit within your setting, providing a flexible introduction that can precede a wide array of stories and themes.

I'm not really a fan of any of these, but keeping it here anyway.
