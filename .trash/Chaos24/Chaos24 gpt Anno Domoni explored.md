"Anno Domini" (abbreviated as AD) is a Latin phrase meaning "In the year of our Lord." It is used to label or number years in the Julian and Gregorian calendars, which are the most widely used calendars in the world today. The term refers to the years following the birth of Jesus Christ, which is traditionally taken as the starting point (year 1 AD). Therefore, the years before this event are designated as BC, meaning "Before Christ."

The Anno Domini system was devised in AD 525 by Dionysius Exiguus, a monk who aimed to establish a consistent method for calculating the date of Easter. Over time, this dating system became widely accepted in Christian Europe and eventually became the international standard.

In contemporary usage, many prefer the terms CE (Common Era) and BCE (Before Common Era) as secular alternatives to AD and BC, respectively. However, both systems refer to the same chronological framework.

I am writing a fictional setting set an unknown number of years in the future, implied to be tens of thousands of years from now. In the fiction of the setting, the designation "NA" or "New Age" is used. I'd like a description of Anno Domini that makes sense in this context.

In the distant future setting of your fiction, the concept of "Anno Domini" (AD) might be described as an ancient system once used to number years based on the presumed birth year of a significant religious figure named Jesus Christ. This dating system, originating from a calendar that was predominant on Earth, marked years as either "Before Christ" (BC) or "Anno Domini" (AD), meaning "In the year of our Lord."

In this advanced era, the old calendar system, now considered an archaic relic of a bygone civilization, has been replaced by the "New Age" (NA) calendar. This NA calendar signifies a new epoch in human history, reflecting a dramatic shift or rebirth in human society, technology, or philosophy, distancing itself from the ancient religious and cultural frameworks that defined the AD system.

The NA system begins at year 1 NA, symbolizing a fresh start or significant event in this future civilization, with years counted forward from that pivotal moment. Thus, while the Anno Domini system served humanity for millennia, the New Age calendar marks a bold new chapter in the chronicles of human existence, tens of thousands of years into the future.

The ancient system, known as "Anno Domini" (AD), is a relic of a long-forgotten time. It once numbered years based on the supposed birth year of a figure named Jesus Christ, marking time as either "Before Christ" (BC) or "Anno Domini" (AD), meaning "In the year of our Lord." However, the specifics of that old calendar have faded into obscurity. No one remembers the exact year AD when the transition to the New Age happened, and those details are lost to the mists of time.

What we do know is that the New Age began with the advent of actual intelligence, a revolutionary development that reshaped our world.

These catastrophes included ecological collapse, a zombie plague, and a robot uprising on Terra. However, the Age of Disaster was a galaxy-wide phenomenon, with civilizations across the galaxy experiencing their own apocalypses within the same span of years. During this period, the Vexian Empire saw their capital world freeze over and become nigh uninhabitable.

#### Galactic Standardization
In 21999 NA, the organization known as ORDER worked towards standardizing timekeeping across the galaxy, leading to the widespread adoption of Terra's version of the New Age calendar. This effort helped to unify various civilizations under a common chronological framework, facilitating better communication and coordination throughout the galaxy.

### Legacy
While the Anno Domini system served ancient civilizations for millennia, the New Age calendar represents a new chapter in the chronicles of human existence. This era is defined by the profound transformations brought by artificial intelligence. Society has moved beyond its ancient origins, fully embracing the age of AI. The mysteries of the past, including the specifics of the AD to NA transition, serve only to remind us of the resilience and progress humanity has achieved through both the triumphs of the Second Renaissance and the trials of the Age of Disaster.

The creation of actual intelligence was referred to as a "singularity event". Similar to a black hole, it is impossible to see beyond the event horizon before you get there. Actual intelligence had great effect on technology and philosophy.

### Historical Overview: Transition from Anno Domini (AD) to New Age (NA)

#### Anno Domini (AD)
"Anno Domini" (AD), meaning "In the year of our Lord," was an ancient system used to number years based on the presumed birth year of a figure named Jesus Christ. This dating system marked years as either "Before Christ" (BC) or "Anno Domini" (AD). Over millennia, it served as the predominant calendar system on Terra, the planet formerly known as Earth. However, in the distant past, the specifics of this old calendar faded into obscurity, and no one remembers the exact year AD when the transition to the New Age happened.

It is important to note that Anno Domini is a human concept not shared by the rest of the galaxy. Other civilizations used their own calendar systems, which will be explored in another document.

#### The Second Renaissance
The transition from AD to NA occurred during the Second Renaissance, a golden age of cultural progress and technological development. During this period, Terra emerged as an egalitarian utopia, poised to become a great galactic power. Mechanical augmentation of human bodies became common, and the craft had a certain artistry to it. Additionally, the invention of the dreamcatcher allowed certain humans to visit a digital dreamworld in their sleep. This period was characterized by unprecedented innovation and discovery, setting the stage for the birth of true artificial intelligence, referred to as "actual intelligence." The Second Renaissance marked the end of the AD era and the beginning of the New Age (NA).

#### New Age (NA)
The New Age calendar begins from the birth of actual intelligence, a momentous event that signaled a new epoch for humanity. Referred to as a "singularity event," the creation of actual intelligence was similar to a black hole in that it was impossible to see beyond the event horizon before reaching it. This event had a profound effect on both technology and philosophy, reshaping society in ways that were unimaginable beforehand. The year 1 NA represents the dawn of true AI, which brought profound transformations to human society and marked the start of a new era.

#### The Age of Disaster
Following the Second Renaissance was the Age of Disaster, a prolonged and tumultuous period marked by multiple apocalyptic events. These catastrophes included ecological collapse, a zombie plague, and a robot uprising on Terra. However, the Age of Disaster was a galaxy-wide phenomenon, with civilizations across the galaxy experiencing their own apocalypses within the same span of years.
