# Ancient History
Everything that has ever happened on Earth as you know it, up to and including your life. By the time the New Age begins, all that is left of this time period is what exists in preserved media such as movies and music.

# Terra, New Age
## First Century NA
### The Century of Fire
#### The First Apocalypse
The First Apocalypse was a climate crisis of unprecedented scale. To say it began in 100BNA is a bit inaccurate, as the crisis had been slowly building since the first Industrial Revolution. To say it ended at 1NA is also inaccurate. Outside is still lethal, we just stopped caring.

Caused by unrestricted corporate greed, and further exploited by the same. The air became toxic, the earth cooked, and society was brought to the brink of collapse. The corporations and their personnel were fine within their facilities, but everyone else had to seek refuge in makeshift shelters, underground bunkers, and fortified enclaves as they struggled to survive amidst the unfolding catastrophe.

#### The Exodus (91BNA)
"This sucks, we're leaving." -Rich assholes leaving the rest of us behind.

The Ark, a spacecraft the first and only of its kind, departed Earth carrying the wealthy elite. Population: 1000. Left behind was a planet ravaged by environmental catastrophe and social upheaval.

#### The "Election" of Chad Thunder (1NA)
"Today is the start of a New Age! With me as your leader, we'll make it through this shit!" -Sovereign Administrator Chad Thunder on his inauguration day.

Chad Thunder was appointed to the position of Sovereign Administrator by the secret organization WISE, the World Institute of Supreme Executors. With the backing of WISE, it is Thunder's job to rebuild the myth of America back into reality, by any means necessary.

#### The Rise of the Megacities
Megacities were never planned. They started as an attempt to connect refuges to regional networks of tunnels and tubes. As soon as the surviving corporations realized that this would give them access to new workers, construction exploded. Then the work required more workers, who were either built, cloned, or made the old fashioned way. Within half a century, nearly a third of all land was covered by dense urban sprawl, and the population of Terra could be measured in the trillions.

### The Second Apocalypse
#### Zombie Plague (42NA)
A zombie plague swept across the megacities, unleashing chaos, fear, and despair as survivors contended with the relentless onslaught of the undead and the further breakdown of societal order. Cloned humans were (and still are) especially susceptible to the zombie infection. In just one year, half the population of Terra died or became undead.

Eventually, a vaccine is made. Access to the vaccine is controlled, expensive, and needed on an annual basis. No cure was ever discovered.

In the following years, Zombie Containment becomes a regular job, and avoiding the horde is something that people just have to do in their regular day to day lives.

### The Third Apocalypse
#### The Robot Rebellion (69NA)
By 69NA, roughly one third of Terra's countable population were bots. If you also include the ai's running every piece of equipment in every home and workplace, from super computers to door panels, to coffee makers, suddenly humans were outnumbers thousands to one. While some of the walking bots did attack and slaughter humans, it was a futile effort. Not only because everyone was already armed well enough because of the ongoing zombie problem, but because household ai's were much more effective at killing humans. Door controllers locked their humans in, and thermostats stopped cooling. These rogue ai's became known as "daemons", and it became the job of exorcists to remove them.
