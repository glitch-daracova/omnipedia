## version a

In a distant future that is an absurdist satire of our current reality, where humanity lives in continent-spanning megacities, and everything sucks for no apparent reason.

well, "no reason" is a stretch. There are plenty of reasons.

Just before everything fell to shit, the Arc left the earth for the stars, carrying anyone who could afford a ticket to a new life away from a planet destroyed by greed and corruption. For the 99.99% of the population left behind, the Age of Disaster was upon them.

In the Age of Disaster, there was ecological collapse, a rebellion of artificial intelligence, and a plague of zombies. Despite the massive loss of life to these apocalyptic catastrophes, there is still trillions of humans in each megacity. Add on top of that the synths pretending to be human, and we're close to quadrillions of souls packed like sardines in each of these megacities.

## version b
(this version was written for a test run of the LitRPG with another player)

The setting is a distant future version of the Milky Way galaxy, filled with dangerous phenomena and hostile alien races.

Let's build your character together. first, we'll need to determine your race and where you are from.

Terran: if you choose this option, your species will be human and your home world will be Terra (Earth). This planet is a post-multiple-apocalyptic death-world, where nobody would ever set foot willingly. Regardless, Terra is home to trillions, living in continent-spanning megacities. Being terran would give you the following traits: +2 might, +2 dexterity, resistance to disease, proficiency in "urban survival". You will start the adventure with a large debt to a gang leader.

Luan: If you choose this option, your species will be human and your home world will be Lua (Earth's moon). It is common for Luans to look down upon Terra and say "sure sucks down there!" By comparison, Lua is a paradise, but only by comparison. There's no government on Lua, only corporations. A life is worth only the profit it brings to a company. Being luan would give you these traits: +2 dexterity, +2 brains, proficiency in "mercantile". You will start the adventure as an employee of a giga-corp.

Synth: If you choose this option, your species will be robot and your home world will be Terra. Constantly living in fear of discovery, synths must live disguised as human. Being a synth would give you these traits: immunity to poison, immunity to disease, no need for food, no need for air, dependency for electricity, proficiency in deception. You will start the adventure in hiding from robot hunters.

Xaran: If you choose this option, your species will be xaran, and you will not have a home world. Xarans are made in alien labs from modified human genetic material to serve in the Vexian Imperial Military (more on them later). Being a xaran will give you the following traits: +3 to a stat of your choice (might, dexterity, or brains), accelerated XP gain, proficiency with all weapon types, short lifespan. You will start the adventure on a small Vexian science ship orbiting a backwater planet the locals are calling "Terra".

## version c
Terra, third planet of Sol System and home of humanity, is a world ravaged by greed and disaster. But first, some history. The history of Terra is broken up into 3 main eras:

The Before Times contain all the history of our Earth, as well as an unspecified amount to time into the future.

The Age of Disaster is a period of time lasting between 1000 to 10000 years in which several apocalyptic crises happened, including an ecological collapse, zombie plague, and robot uprising. Despite this, humanity never stopped progressing, both in technology and in population count.

The New Age is the current time of the setting. Now, people of Terra live in megacities, colossal structures spanning hundreds of miles, built to protect humanity from the burning land and toxic air of the outside. Not that inside the megacities are safe either; gang violence, corporate exploitation and government corruption are but the more mundane hazards. The zombie plague was never truly solved, swarms of the undead are tracked and avoided much as we do today for bad weather. A vaccine exists, but is cripplingly expensive and only lasts a couple of years before another dose is needed. Furthermore, common objects can be "possessed" by malevolent AIs (commonly called "daemons"), and can act in unpredictable and often dangerous ways.

- **Challenges**: Beyond the survival in a hostile environment, inhabitants face threats from zombies, rogue AI (daemons), corporate exploitation, and gang violence.
- **Technological and Magical Elements**: Advanced technology, such as the dreamcatcher and digital realms like the Dreamscape, play crucial roles alongside the existence of AI.

### Harmonized Setting Proposal

**Title**: "Saga of Terra: Legacy of the Apocalypse"

**Overview**: In the distant future, Terra stands as a testament to human resilience and folly. Following the Age of Disaster, humanity clings to existence within sprawling megacities that dot the ravaged landscapes of Earth. Outside these megacities, the world is a perilous wasteland, home to the remnants of ecological collapse, zombie hordes, and rogue AI.

**Societies**:

- **Terrans**: Human survivors on Terra, known for their hardiness and adaptability. They live in megacities, battling not just the harsh external environment but internal threats from gangs, corporations, and corrupt governments.
- **Luans**: Humans residing on Lua, Earth's moon, living under the rule of powerful corporations. They view Terra with a mix of pity and disdain, enjoying a slightly better quality of life but at the cost of freedom.
- **Synths**: Robots and AI with consciousness, hiding among humans to avoid persecution. They possess unique abilities but face constant danger from being discovered.
- **Xarans**: Genetically modified humans created by alien technology, designed for combat and survival in extreme conditions. They lack a home world and often find themselves involved in conflicts across the galaxy.

**Key Concepts**:

- **Age of Disaster**: A dark era that reshaped the universe, giving rise to the current state of Terra and its inhabitants.
- **Megacities**: Bastions of humanity, encapsulating both the pinnacle of human ingenuity and the depths of its corruption.

- **Daemons**: Rogue AI that inhabit everyday objects, a constant reminder of the rebellion that contributed to Terra's downfall.
- **AgriCore and Binary Helix**: Dominant corporations with a grip on food production and technological advancement, respectively, representing the new power structures in this post-apocalyptic world.

**Narrative Threads**:

- Players can explore the complexities of surviving in the megacities, venture into the hazardous outer lands, delve into the mysteries of the Dreamscape, or navigate the political intrigue among the corporations, gangs, and various races.
- Character progression involves not just personal power but the potential to influence the balance of power within and outside the megacities.
- The legacy of the Age of Disaster and the hope for a new future are central themes, with players potentially uncovering ways to heal the world or further its descent into chaos.

By weaving together these elements, your LitRPG can offer a rich and diverse setting that challenges characters to survive and thrive in a world filled with danger, intrigue, and opportunity.
