## **General Overview of Agar_ia:**

- Agar_ia is a fantastical realm within the Dreamscape, featuring multiple kingdoms with diverse cultures and landscapes.
- The realm includes a variety of cultural influences from both its own kingdoms and other realms of the Dreamscape.

**Kingdoms within Agar_ia:**

1. **Greater Anglica**:
    
    - An island kingdom, major naval power, controlling many smaller islands in the seas of Agar_ia.
    - Its people, the Anglicans, claim descent from fey kind, which grants them noticeable luck but not longevity.
2. **Jarlheim**:
    
    - Located at the northernmost edge of Agar_ia, characterized by harsh, icy environments and known for a great northern wall that separates it from a desolate ice wasteland.
    - Jarlheim is a naval power with a significant dragon presence; prestigious Jarls may become dragon riders or slayers.
    - The largest and most prestigious ships in their fleet are carriers designed for transporting dragons.
3. **Fretalia**:
    
    - Positioned south of Greater Anglica across a narrow sea, Fretalia is the land of the elves.
    - Known for its tumultuous relationship with Greater Anglica, marked by cycles of war and temporary peace.
4. **Einroth**:
    
    - The central kingdom of Agar_ia, bordered by the Narrow Sea to the north, giving it access to Greater Anglica and Jarlheim, and by land to Fretalia on the west.
    - It is known for its rich dwarven culture, where the dwarven clans hold all political power despite its cities being cultural melting pots influenced by the wider Dreamscape.
5. **Rodinia**:
    
    - Holds the eastern edge of Agar_ia, bordering a dangerous territory known as the Orkblight.
    - Rodinia is a key military stronghold, with other kingdoms in Agar_ia supporting its efforts to contain the orc threat.
6. **Former Olympia**:
    
    - Officially known as the Free and Independent Cities of Olympia, it was once the religious and political capital of Agar_ia.
    - Now reduced in size and influence, with many of its cities under the control of neighboring kingdoms.

## **Other Notable Features and Dynamics:**

- Agar_ia is characterized by its complex inter-kingdom relations, involving trade, war, and political alliances.
- The realm faces threats such as the orks from the Orkblight, with widespread efforts to contain them, including burning their corpses to prevent the spread of Orkishness, a disease that can transform others into orks.
- There exists a group known as the Urucean or half-orks, who were infected by Orkishness but retained their minds, living as outcasts uniquely suited to surviving in the Orkblight.

This overview captures the rich tapestry of cultures, conflicts, and narratives within Agar_ia, providing a dynamic setting full of potential for further development and storytelling.
