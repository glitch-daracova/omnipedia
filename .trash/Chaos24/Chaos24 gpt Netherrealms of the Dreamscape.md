I suppose this is as good a time as any to talk about the dreamscape's netherrealms.

![[bin/AI.webp|100]]
**ChatGPT**

The concept of netherrealms within the Dreamscape adds another layer of depth and complexity to your narrative universe. These could serve various purposes and embody a range of themes depending on their characteristics and how they interact with the broader Dreamscape. Here’s a brief overview of potential roles and attributes that netherrealms might have:

### Definition and Nature

**Netherrealms** in the Dreamscape could be considered parallel or lower dimensions that exist beneath or beyond the primary dream realms. These realms might be:

- **Inherently magical or mystical**, hosting ancient secrets or forgotten powers.
- **Dangerous and forbidden**, often associated with darker or more malevolent forces.
- **Inaccessible to ordinary dreamers**, requiring special means or powers to enter.

### Functions and Roles

Netherrealms might serve multiple functions within the Dreamscape:

- **Sanctuaries or prisons** for entities that are too powerful, dangerous, or different to exist in the main realms.
- **Sources of rare magical resources or knowledge**, attracting those brave or desperate enough to venture into them.
- **Battlefields or testing grounds** for dreamers or beings seeking to prove their worth or resolve complex challenges.
- **Connective spaces** that allow for travel between disparate regions of the Dreamscape, albeit at potentially high risks.

### Interactions with the Main Realms

The relationship between netherrealms and the main realms of the Dreamscape could vary:

- **Isolated but influential**, where events or entities in the netherrealms subtly or overtly affect the higher realms.
- **Tightly integrated**, with constant interactions that may involve trade, conflicts, or alliances.
- **Mystically tethered**, where changes in one realm could cause corresponding shifts in the other, bound by magical or cosmic laws.

### Governance and Inhabitants

- **Ruled by unique entities or collectives**, such as fallen gods, ancient spirits, or powerful dream constructs that cannot exist in the normal realms.
- **Home to creatures and beings**, each adapted to the peculiar conditions of their netherrealm, ranging from the bizarre to the terrifying.

### Narrative Use

In your story, netherrealms can be used to:

- **Drive major plot arcs**, such as quests to recover lost artifacts or rescue characters from these realms.
- **Develop character backstories and motivations**, particularly for characters who originate from or have been changed by their experiences in these realms.
- **Introduce moral and ethical dilemmas**, such as the consequences of tapping into the dangerous powers or knowledge found in netherrealms.

By defining the specific attributes and roles of the netherrealms in your Dreamscape, you can create a rich, multidimensional setting that enhances the complexity and allure of your narrative universe. If you have specific ideas or elements you'd like to discuss or develop further regarding the netherrealms, feel free to share, and I can help you flesh them out!

Great! It sounds like you have a vivid and engaging concept in mind for the netherrealms. If there's any specific aspect you'd like to expand on, such as developing particular netherrealms, exploring their interactions with the main realms, or integrating them into your characters' stories, just let me know. I'm here to help with any details or to brainstorm further ideas!

We recently went over how Noct_yr is directly connected to its netherrealm, to such an extent that I wouldn't even consider them separate. To contrast, in Agar_ia, the netherrealm is just where people go when they die and few ever return.

![[bin/AI.webp|100]]
**ChatGPT**

That's an interesting contrast between Noct_yr and Agar_ia, highlighting different cultural and existential concepts within your universe. In Noct_yr, the blending of the netherrealm and the main realm could suggest a deeper integration of life, death, and possibly darker forces within everyday existence. In contrast, Agar_ia's view of the netherrealm as a distant afterlife creates a clear division between the living world and the world of the dead, which could influence how its inhabitants view mortality and the afterlife.

If you'd like to explore these themes further or incorporate specific narratives that delve into the implications of these different relationships with their respective netherrealms, I'm here to help develop those stories.

Dreamers who are able to navigate the netherrealms, as well as the demons who live there, can attest that all the netherrealms are connected. Much like how the normal realms are connected, except that there's usually a lot of rock in the way, and rarely is there visible sky.

![[bin/AI.webp|100]]
**ChatGPT**

The interconnected nature of the netherrealms, with their labyrinthine passages and limited sky visibility, sets up a mysterious and often perilous underworld landscape. This connectivity could be a crucial plot device, allowing for secretive or unexpected movements between realms, strategic escapes, or perilous journeys.

If you're interested in exploring how these interconnected netherrealms impact the larger narrative, such as facilitating unexpected alliances, enabling invasions, or serving as hiding places for important characters or items, I can help flesh out these scenarios.

Those who can, attest that traveling by way of netherrealm is much faster than normal travel, assuming the same travel speed. Depending on the realm, a journey could take 1/2, 1/8, or even 1/64 the time. This is because netherrealms are smaller than normal realms, so a shorter distance needs to be travelled to arrive at the same location.

![[bin/AI.webp|100]]
**ChatGPT**

The concept of using netherrealms as a faster travel route adds a strategic element to navigation within your universe. This could lead to intriguing plot developments, such as races against time, stealthy troop movements, or the quick spread of information or diseases that could impact various realms unexpectedly.

If you’d like to develop specific scenarios leveraging this faster travel capability, whether for dramatic chases, strategic battles, or secretive missions, I can help create those detailed plots.

I've mentioned "demons" a couple of times. This word can be confusing, because I'm using the same word to refer to two very different concepts. There's the fire and brimstone demons that live in the netherrealms of the dreamscape. This is perfectly normal and we expect them to be there. There's also the malevolent and malfunctioning AIs in the waking world that people mistakenly refer to as demons. These demons possess computerized equipment to wreck havoc on unsuspecting people. To make this even more confusing, if we consider that the fringes of the dreamscape connect to computers in the waking world, it is possible for one kind of demon to become the other kind of demon.

![[bin/AI.webp|100]]
**ChatGPT**

The dual use of "demons" in your story creates a richly layered concept that bridges the supernatural and technological aspects of your universe. This ambiguity not only deepens the narrative complexity but also sets up potential for intriguing conflicts and misunderstandings between characters and worlds.

Exploring scenarios where these two types of demons interact or transform could lead to fascinating story arcs involving misunderstandings, invasions, or alliances between the realms of technology and magic. If you want to develop specific plots or explore the implications of these interconnected demon concepts further, I'm here to assist in fleshing out those ideas.

I think I've mentioned a character by name of Sala Otanashi, are you familiar?

![[bin/AI.webp|100]]
**ChatGPT**

Yes, you've mentioned Sala Otanashi before. She is from Neo Tokyo 4 and met Glitch in the dreamscape. Sala used Glitch's feelings for her to advance her social movements, which has left Glitch with mixed feelings of admiration and regret regarding their relationship. If there's more about Sala or her interactions that you'd like to explore, feel free to share!

Much later in the story, around the time of ORDER on New Earth, Sala has become a demon overlord of the dreamscape netherrealm Pandemon_ium. Seeing demons as "just people, but different looking", she established Pandemon_ium as a refuge for demonkind. She uses trains and a rail network to travel the netherrealms at blistering speeds.

![[bin/AI.webp|100]]
**ChatGPT**

Sala Otanashi's transformation into a demon overlord and her role in establishing Pandemon_ium as a sanctuary for demons adds a compelling layer to her character development. This position allows her to advocate for a misunderstood and often marginalized group, portraying her as both a leader and a protector. The use of a train and rail network for rapid transit through the netherrealms is a fascinating detail that merges the fantastical with a touch of steampunk or industrial flair. If you're interested in exploring how Sala's actions impact the broader dynamics of the Dreamscape or her interactions with other characters, I can help develop those narratives further.

At some point in her story, Sala died in the waking world. Her continued existence is proof that hell is real, and it's in the dreamscape. At least, that's her view on it.

![[bin/AI.webp|100]]
**ChatGPT**

Sala Otanashi's perspective that her existence in the Dreamscape as proof of hell adds a profound philosophical layer to her character and the narrative. This belief could influence her leadership style and her interactions with both demons and other beings in the Dreamscape. It opens up avenues for exploring themes of existence, morality, and redemption in a unique setting. If you want to delve into how Sala's beliefs affect her decisions, or the impact on those around her, I can help develop those story elements.

Not all netherrealms are hellish, actually, most aren't. Netherrealms are simply called as such because they exist literally beneath the normal realms. Demon Overlords bring war and suffering to otherwise tranquil afterlives.

![[bin/AI.webp|100]]
**ChatGPT**

That clarification broadens the understanding of netherrealms beyond traditional notions of hell, presenting them as diverse realms with their own cultures and existences that can be dramatically altered by the actions of Demon Overlords. This dynamic introduces conflict and complexity, providing a rich backdrop for stories about the balance between peace and turmoil, the effects of power, and the struggles for control. If you're interested in exploring how these invasions by Demon Overlords affect the various netherrealms or specific characters, I can help outline those narratives.

Related: angels are just a different species of demon.

![[bin/AI.webp|100]]
**ChatGPT**

That's a fascinating take on angels and demons, blending them into a singular spectrum rather than viewing them as opposites. This concept could add depth to your world's mythology, challenging conventional perceptions and exploring themes of morality and identity. If you're interested in how this viewpoint impacts the interactions between these beings and the larger narrative, I'm here to help develop those ideas further.

also related: the difference between a devil and a demon. Demon is a species, or category of species (I haven't really decided yet). A demon is a demon because of what it physically is. A devil is a job. Something similar to a lawyer mixed with politician mixed with corporate executive. A devil is a devil because of what it does.

![[bin/AI.webp|100]]
**ChatGPT**

That distinction offers a clear and intriguing way to define these entities in your narrative. By categorizing "demon" as a species and "devil" as a profession, you create a rich hierarchy and social structure within the demonic realms that can lead to complex character dynamics and plotlines. This setup allows for stories involving political intrigue, legal battles, and corporate maneuvers within the context of the supernatural. If you'd like to explore how these roles impact individual characters or the broader societal structures in your world, I'm here to assist in fleshing out those details.

Similarly, Demon Overlord is also a profession. Something in between a military general and crowned monarch.

![[bin/AI.webp|100]]
**ChatGPT**

The role of "Demon Overlord" adds another layer of authority and responsibility within the demonic hierarchy. It suggests a position of great power and influence, overseeing large territories or groups of demons. This role can involve complex strategic decisions, battlefield command, and the intricacies of ruling a realm. If you're interested in exploring the challenges and stories of one or more Demon Overlords in your narrative, such as their rise to power, governance styles, or conflicts with other realms or overlords, I can help develop those storylines.

Please summarize everything you now know about the dreamscape's netherrealms. Be verbose.

![[bin/AI.webp|100]]
**ChatGPT**

The netherrealms within the Dreamscape offer a multifaceted and deeply integrated aspect of your expansive narrative universe. Here’s a detailed overview of the various aspects, functions, and the cultural significance of the netherrealms:

### Definition and Nature

**Netherrealms** are conceptualized as layers or dimensions that exist beneath the primary realms of the Dreamscape. They are not inherently hellish; rather, they vary greatly in nature, ranging from tranquil and serene environments that serve as afterlives to more tumultuous and dangerous locales. The term "netherrealm" is derived from their position beneath the normal realms, rather than any specific malevolent characteristics.

### Connectivity and Travel

Netherrealms are interconnected, similar to how the main realms are connected but usually separated by substantial physical barriers such as rock, making navigation challenging. Despite this, traveling through netherrealms can be significantly faster than traveling through normal realms due to their condensed nature. Distances are shorter, allowing for quicker traversal between points that might take much longer to reach in the upper realms.

### Inhabitants and Culture

The netherrealms are populated by beings commonly referred to as demons, which encompass a broad spectrum of entities, including what are traditionally considered angels in other mythologies—here, just another species of demon. This categorization challenges traditional moral binaries and opens up nuanced interpretations of these beings' nature and motivations.

### Societal Roles

## In this context, the terms **demon** and **devil** serve distinct roles:

- **Demons** are defined by their species or physical attributes.
- **Devils** take on specific roles akin to lawyers, politicians, or corporate executives, where their status as devils is defined by their actions and responsibilities within the demonic society.

Additionally, the title of **Demon Overlord** is a professional designation, indicating a role that combines elements of a military general and a crowned monarch. This suggests a structured and possibly hierarchical society within the netherrealms, where power, governance, and military prowess are crucial.

### Conflicts and Governance

Netherrealms, while often peaceful, can experience turmoil and conflict, particularly when Demon Overlords exert influence or expand their territories. These overlords may wage wars, forge alliances, and govern their domains with a combination of strategic military tactics and regal authority, impacting the broader dynamics of the netherrealms.

### Spiritual and Existential Significance

For some characters, like Sala Otanashi, the netherrealms represent a literal form of hell within the Dreamscape, challenging their perceptions of life, death, and afterlife. This existential aspect offers rich ground for exploring themes of morality, redemption, and the consequences of one's actions in life and beyond.

### Interaction with the Waking World

The fringes of the netherrealms can connect to computers in the waking world, allowing for a fascinating crossover between digital and supernatural realms. This interconnectivity can lead to transformations where digital entities become demonic beings and vice versa, blurring the lines between technology and mysticism.

The netherrealms in your narrative provide a complex and layered setting that can be used to explore a wide range of themes from power dynamics and existential questions to the blending of technology and magic. If you'd like to delve deeper into any specific aspect of the netherrealms or develop particular storylines set within this intriguing part of your universe, I'm here to assist in fleshing out those details.
