**This incomplete system is no longer being used, and is retained for reference only. Go to Chaos22 Home instead.**

A simplification of 5e to be used for Erehwon and other Chaos Multiverse runs.

## Useful Links

[5e Introduction Page](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/introduction) – You should be familiar with this before diving into Chaos. Since this ruleset is based off of 5e, a cursory understanding of 5e is recommended.

[What can I do on My Turn?](https://crobi.github.io/dnd5e-quickref/preview/quickref.html) – A very good breakdown of the kinds of things that you can do on your turn.

[DnDBeyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) is an amazing resource for 5e content. Many items, spells, and mechanics will be pulled from this resource. If you need an online spellbook, use theirs.

[RolZ](https://rolz.org/) is a powerful online die roller able to make use of macros and such. Highly recommended if physical dice are not available.

[Map of the 2e Multiverse](https://www.deviantart.com/mcmagnanimus/art/Map-of-the-Dungeons-and-Dragons-2e-Multiverse-v2-0-629694362?ga_submit_new=10%253A1471810307&ga_type=edit&ga_changes=1&ga_recent=1) – Second Edition had the most comprehensive multiverse of any DnD edition. It’s time that I stop trying to reinvent the wheel (heh), and lean into what wizards of the coast (well, it was TSR back then) have already done.

## Cool Homebrew

This is a collection of homebrews that I think are cool. I can’t promise that they’re usable, but if you want to make use of them, let me know and I’ll see what we can do.
