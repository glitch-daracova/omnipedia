> #### About Weapons
> 
> There are too many kinds of weapons to make a cheat sheet for them here. Check out the official listing of weapons atÂ [DnDBeyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment?filter-search=weapon&filter-cost-min=&filter-cost-max=&filter-weight-min=&filter-weight-max=).

### Melee Weapon Attacks

Roll 1d20 + Might Mod + PB to hit. If the total equals or is more than the target's AC, deal damage equal to your weapon's damage value + your Might Mod. Damage may be affected by masteries.

### Ranged Weapon Attacks

Roll 1d20 + Skill Mod + PB to hit. If the total equals or is more than the target's AC, deal damage equal to your weapon's damage value + your Skill Mod. Damage may be affected by masteries.

### Spell Attacks

Roll 1d20 + Brains Mod + PB to hit. If the total equals or is more than the target's AC, deal damage equal as described by the spell. Damage may be affected by masteries.

Sometimes, a spell will call for the target to make a save instead of you making an attack roll. In that case, the spell save DC is 10 + Brains Mod + PB.
