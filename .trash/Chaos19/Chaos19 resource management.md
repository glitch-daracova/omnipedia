# Resource Management
return to [[ChaosisEternal/Chaos19/Chaos19 Home]]

_ Resource management is an important part of DnD. Itâ€™s the most driving force for decision making in strategic games. How and when you choose to spend those resources can be the difference between victory and death. An interesting game should encourage you to think about these choices, instead of simply allowing you to spam your best stuff ad infinitum.

_ The resources available to you are Health, Mana, Heart Dice, Attunement, Hero Points, and Exhaustion.

## Recovery During Rests

_ Your resources can be regained as shown on the table below. Do note that references to masteries may be incomplete.

_ Short rest benefits can be taken multiple times if the appropriate time is spent resting. Long rest benefits can only be taken once in any 24 hour period.
