# Masteries Index
return to [[ChaosisEternal/Chaos19/Chaos19 Home]]

### Types of Masteries

Due to the increasingly large number of masteries, going forward they will be organized into three categories.

-   Martial masteries affect your ability to physically attack and defend.
-   Utility masteries affect maximum resources, their recovery, mobility, and anything that doesn’t neatly fit into the other categories.
-   Magical masteries affect spellcasting and spell like abilities.

If a mastery is an extension to another mastery, then it will be categorized based off of it’s parent mastery, even if it would otherwise be in a different category.

Furthermore, some masteries in the above listed categories are prestige masteries. Prestige masteries are powerful, and have great requirements and limitations. You may take your first prestige mastery once you have achieved character level 7, and then only if you meet all the requirements for that mastery. You may take a second prestige mastery once you have achieved character level 14, and a third at character level 20.

The list is going to be a mess, as markdown breaks tables.

_Prerequisite: At least one rank of RAGE!_

When certain thematically dependent conditions are met, your RAGE! becomes exceptionally powerful. Conditions will vary from character to character. While in effect, the following conditions apply:

-   An extra action on your turn that can be used to make an attack (one attack only), dash, or disengage action.
-   All attacks that hit are critical.
-   You are compelled to deal with whatever caused your exceptional RAGE!. Failing to do so causes you to immediately fall out of RAGE!, and you are unable to RAGE! again until the DM says so (varies based on character details and DM’s discretion).

## Combat Superiority

_NOTE: This mastery can be taken multiple times for additional effect as shown._

Your martial prowess grants you greater adaptability in a fight. [You gain access to the list of maneuvers shown on the Combat Superiority page.](http://www.chaosiseternal.com/ccr/combat-superiority/) Using a maneuver costs one Hero Point.

Some maneuvers call for a target to make a save. For this, you will use a Martial Save DC, which is your Might Mod OR your Skill Mod (your choice), plus your PB, plus 8.

Maneuvers will call for you to roll a Superiority Die. This starts as a d4, but can be improved by taking additional ranks of this mastery as shown.

Your maximum mana points are doubled. The new calculation is = (Brains Score + 25) * Character Level * 2.

## False Life

_Prerequisite: DM’s sanction only._

Your physical body is not what matters, but rather the soul that inhabits it. Speak with your DM to determine by what method you possess bodies. You might be a ghost, a lich, or something else entirely. Because there is so much possible variation in what this mastery entails, specific details will not be described here.

In general, these properties probably apply to you.

-   You are technically immortal. Technically.
-   You have weakness to silver damage, radiant damage, and chaos damage.
-   If you need to change your character sheet because you changed bodies, your masteries and proficiencies will stay the same, but your ability scores will change to reflect your new body. Special traits dependent upon that body will be lost and replaced with new traits as appropriate.
-   Changing bodies takes time. Depending on character details, it could range from a single day to many years.

## Flash Step

## Flash Bash

## Gish

## Heroic Rescue

When an ally is targeted by a melee attack, you may as a reaction run to intercept the attack, making yourself the target instead. When you do so, you must take the most direct route possible, and this distance cannot exceed your movement speed. Your next attack, if it targets the creature whose attack you intercepted, deals 1dx bonus damage for each attack of opportunity you provoked while rushing to the rescue. This bonus damage can be added on top of other sources of bonus damage.

## Hyper Critical

When calculating your AC, use your Might mod instead of your Skill mod.

## Lay on Hands

Once per round, when you cast a healing spell on a creature that you can touch (not yourself), add your PB to the amount healed for each level of the spell.

If you don’t have Spellcasting, you can as an action spend 10 mana to heal a target you can touch for 8 + your Brains Mod + your PB (this is equal to casting Cure Wounds as a 1st level spell with this mastery).

If you are able to cast Cure Wounds thanks to other means, you can do so as a bonus action.

Healing with this mastery cannot affect undead nor constructs.

## LUCK!

The astral chaos favors you.
