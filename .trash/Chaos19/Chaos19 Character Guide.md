## Race and Subrace

## Assign Ability Scores

Your ability scores describe your physical capabilities. Might is your strength and constitution. Skill is your dexterity and charisma. Brains is your intelligence and wisdom.

All ability scores start at a value of 8, with a roll modifier of -1. You have 37 Ability Score Improvement points (or ASI points) available to distribute among the three ability scores. If your choice of race modifies your ability scores, do so before spending your ASI points.

Ability scores provide bonuses to their applicable rolls as shown.
