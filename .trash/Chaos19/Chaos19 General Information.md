# General Information
(return to [[ChaosisEternal/Chaos19/Chaos19 Home]])

-   The DM is GOD.
-   Have fun, but not at the expense of other players.
-   Unless stated otherwise, 5e rules takes precedence.
-   Always Round Down.
-   Attacks can Crit, Checks and Saves cannot. Critical hits deal double damage, which is calculated after all other considerations.
-   There is no such thing as a “Critical Failure”. For Attack Rolls, a 1 is an automatic miss. For Death Saves, a 1 counts as 2 failures. Otherwise, a 1 is just a 1, calculate the result as you would for any other number.
-   Advantage from multiple sources does not stack, neither does Disadvantage. You either have it or you don’t. If you have both, regardless of how many of each you have, they cancel each other out and the roll is made normally.
-   Any time a die that is not a d20 must be rolled for damage or healing, take the maximum value of the die instead of rolling. (DM specific)
-   Your actions have consequences. You are not immune to your own stuff purely by nature of it being yours.
-   Death Saves and Meta Rolls cannot be modified by anything, ever.

#### LVL

Character Level. Not to be confused with spell levels or mastery levels.

#### Mod

Short for Roll Modifier, usually in the context of how your Ability Scores actually affect your rolls.

#### PB

Proficiency Bonus. A number aside from your Ability Scores that indicates how good you are at things you’re good at.

#### 1dx

This is calling for you to roll one die in which the size of that die is determined by something else. This is most commonly used for Bonus Damage, where the size of the die is the same as what was used for the original damage source.
