Chaos is Eternal

::*No preamble. Just go*.::

::**But they won't know what's going on.**::

::*You tried that, it didn't work.*::

::**Fine.**::

Heavy footsteps echo in the dark, clanking against the worn stone of the corridoor's floor. Up ahead, blinding daylight could be seen through a rusted portcullis. A style of gate that relied on hidden mechanisms to open, mechanisms that were plainly visible and plainly broken. It mattered not if it was deliberate sabotage, or simply the destructive passing of time that caused the ruin. It mattered only that this gate would not open. The remaining question though, was if it would be easier to find another exit, or break through the portcullis? With a sigh, he-

::I.::

::Relax, we'll get there.::

::It's important that they know it's me.::

::They will, once it matters. For now it will just confuse them.::

With a sigh, he approached the gate. Anyone who looked inwards wouldn't see him, clad in black armor from head to toe. Two swords hung from his left hip, a spear in his right hand, a bag on his back stuffed full of ill-gotten gains. With his left hand, he grasped a rusted bar and gave it a shake. It may as well have been set in cement. Muttering expletives under his breath, he drew the longer of his two swords, it's edge igniting red as it left the scabbard. It would take time to cut the bars, time he didn't have. Thunder cracked nearby as the outside light began to dim. Rain began to fall. Time was up. He swung, hard. The guild smith was going to be pissed. Another swing, and enough bars fell to the ground that he could slip through. Once on the other side, he sheathed the blade, no reason to damage it more than necessary.

This ancient temple to a forgotten god sat in the middle of a small clearing, surrounded on all sides by dense jungle. The underground chambers would begin to flood in an hour. It wasn't the rain he was worried about, though. Sure, the rain would make travel a bit more difficult, and cause some rust that would be costly to repair. The current haul would easily pay for everything, and more. Perhaps with the profits, he could get one of those newfangled flintlock weapons?

But this wasn't the time for musing, this was the time for running. By stepping off of roots and rocks, he was able to make a good pace, but was it good enough? As the rain became a downpour, he knew he wouldn't be able to hear anything coming, and turning to look would only slow him down. If he was lucky, there would only be one, mentally crossing out the possibility of getting away scot free. What was left of the sunlight had already been blotted out by storm clouds, and the rain cut his effective darkvision down to a mere ten feet. One bad step and he'd be stuck in mud.

Of course, as soon as he had the thought, it happened.

"FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!" he screamed, almost as loud as the thunder that immediately followed. Mud swallowed his right leg up to the knee. Where he guessed that a root should be was actually a much less sturdy fern leaf. Regaining his balance wasn't difficult, he just wouldn't be going anywhere any time soon. Committing to his terrible position, he turned and readied his spear.

The dark and the rain only hindered his ability to see the surrounding terrain. His enemy would be plainly visible, although not because of any special senses on his part. Seconds ticked by and the thunder became louder and louder. Then suddenly, there it was, or rather, there she was. Coagulated lightning slithered across the ground in the shape of an obviously female naga. She carried no weapons, nor armor, and was clothed only in lightning as it crackled around her and into the surrounding terrain. She needed no physical armaments, the lightning was enough for her purposes.

::Ooh, isn't she the cutie? I'm surprised you didn't try to fuck her.::

::Please, I have some self control.::

The naga lunged forwards, streaking over the mud. Claws of lightning reaching forwards, but never arriving, interrupted by a spearpoint. Pierced through the heart, she didn't stand a chance. Electrical discharges were still painful to the armor clad man, but nothing he couldn't survive.

The delay, however, was costly. Without warning, great bells began to toll, echoing from a world beyond.

In one fluid motion, Glitch Daracova leaped out of bed and flung his headset onto a nearby chair. The NeuroLink could easily handle such abuse, as it had many times before. He scrambled around his tiny bedroom, rushing to get dressed and shut off numerous alarms.

Phone, wallet, keys, backpack, shoes, out the door.

::Spectacles, testicles, watch?::

::I never saw that movie..::

::A shame, it was a good one.::
