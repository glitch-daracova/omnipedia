Every hero has an origin story. This one's mine. Well, ours. Well, actually, it's complicated.

Don't worry about who I am just yet, technically I didn't exist back then. Like I said, complicated.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

Maybe I should just get on with it.

The New Age. The Golden Era. The Second Renaissance. People had a lot of names for the time we where in. If you've seen any movie ever, you'd know we where due for a robot uprising. Either we managed to avoid that somehow, or it hadn't happened yet. Of course, nobody knew we where supposed to have had a number of apocalyptic scenarios play out already. It's not like we had the ability to look at how other Earths turned out back then.

I was, he, Iâ€¦.

Imma stick to the first person for the sake of simplicity. By the time it matters, you'll know why that's even an issue.

The Beginning. Stay on topic.

Black power armor. Red energy sword. My footsteps echoing in the dark. A metal portcullis surrounded by brown stone leads to the blinding daylight. I stepped out, and the portcullis slammed shut behind me.

Sand covered the ground. The area was surrounded by walls of more brown stone. The crowds in the stands up above the walls screamed and cheered, doing whatever crowds do. It wasn't unlike a classic roman coliseum, it just had modern people in it.

The announcer stood on his floating metal disk, it had no visible means of propulsion. He struggled to be heard over the crowd. I assumed he was explaining who was fighting, what the rules where, so on. I wasn't listening. I already knew.

Across from me was the reigning champion. I liked to call him Edgelord. He didn't like that. Edgelord also wore the black and red, which was a shame because between the two of us I had it first and it looked better on me anyway.

At least I wasn't wearing a dress.

That's not to say that men shouldn't ever wear dresses, just that Edgelord wasn't doing it right.

The announcer was automated. Part of the reason why nobody cared what he said. Edgelord waved at the crowd, sparks in his hands. I counted seconds. When the announcer finally called the fight to start, I was already in motion. I will end this with a single strike.

Three seconds to cross the arena.

I swing.

What?

Edgelord dissolves. No, he wasn't even there. An illusion. When did he cast it? HUD sensors indicate that he's behind me, in the middle of the arena.

A shockwave impacts me in the back. I get thrown to the ground, visor full of sand.

I flip over just in time to see him standing over me, hands outstretched, palms filled with lightning.

How did he move so fast?

I have no time to react as lightning arcs into my armor, frying circuits and organics alike.

My vision goes dark.

It's over.

I took off my headset and stood up from my chair on the stage. Edgelord was already doing his victory dance while the big screens show a replay of the fight. What I saw didn't match what I experienced. Edgelord was a cheating bastard.

I am still bitter about it to this day.

I decided not to stick around for the after party. More fights where scheduled, but the main event was over.
