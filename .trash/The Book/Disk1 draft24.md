Before we get started, I am not an artist. Never was. The skills I had in my old life don't really translate well to this world, so I can't afford to hire an artist either. The story is mine, but I will be using generative AI to help tell it. If that upsets you, go ahead and be upset. I don't care.

Anyway.

Every hero has an origin story, but this isn't a comic. Events happened, and this is an attempt to record those events. It may seem as fiction to you, who is now likely reading this on Earth in the early 21st century. The Earth I am from, we didn't call it Earth and the 21st century had long passed.

I can't tell you what year it was, because we honestly didn't know. I was born 87 years after humanity started counting again. We called it the "New Age", so 87NA. It was a peaceful existence. You might disagree, considering the scorched sky, robots for neighbors, zombies in the sewers, and corporations older than living memory controlling everything, but it was normal to me.

And then it was all gone.

Or rather, I was.

I woke up screaming.

It took me a while to realize why, everything just hurt too much. Later, perhaps seconds, perhaps hours, the pain receded. I could barely move, I was strapped down to a cot. Naked. Scars crisscrossed my body like I had been dissected by an overzealous bio student. An IV filled with fuck knows what pierced my left arm. I'd never done morphine before, but I imagined something similar was in that concoction. The room itself was cluttered with machines serving vaguely medical purposes. The smells of bleach and death hung in the air.

Was I sick, or was the ground MOVING?

Nevermind that. I had to focus. Focus on getting out of there. But how? My hands were tied, I was strapped to a fuckin' cot. What could I do? Yank on the straps until they ... broke?

Well, if I knew it was going to be that easy I'd have done it sooner. I popped the straps with little resistance, and pulled the IV out of my arm. I got up, and searched the room for anything of use. Sadly, pretty much everything was nailed down. The cot had a bedsheet I could take for a makeshift toga, but that was it.

As I approached the door to leave, I heard more screams. Someone else had woken up. I wondered if I could find them. I wondered if I wanted to. Focus. The door wasn't locked. I hadn't touched the doorknob yet, but I knew. Something to worry about later. Proceeding out to the hallway beyond, I instantly knew something else: this place was going to be a fuckin' maze.

Might as well start walking.

I wasn't sure where I was going, but I was sure I was going the "right" way. The "wrong" paths just didn't look valid, despite being identical to every hallway before. In hindsight, of course, I know what was going on, but at the time I had no idea. Nor did I have the spare attention span to worry about it.

A door caught my attention. Unlocked, I knew before I even reached for it. On the other side I found a closet full of junk.

A treasure trove of things I couldn't take with me. What was useful? What wasn't? Fuck if I knew. Leaning against the back wall was a length of pipe. Three feet long and one inch in outer diameter. It wasn't heavy, but it felt good to hold. I smashed a random box experimentally. Yes, this would do nicely.

The fuck?

With my left hand I reached towards my face. I was not wearing a VR headset. I saw the word before me all the same.

{Swordsman lv0}

Level zero my ass. This will just be a new game for me to conquer.

With a flick of my hand, I dismissed the popup, same way I always did. Without hesitation, I made another gesture to open my heads-up display. Of course, it obliged. It wasn't they layout I was familiar with, but I could easily tell what everything was. Health, stamina, experience, ammunition (infinite for a melee weapon), mana (can't wait to find out what that will be used for), subtitles for ambient sounds (good on the devs for thinking about deaf players), crosshairs in the center of my vision. I swung the pipe at another box, it impacted satisfyingly.

I was ready.

Which was good, because I felt a change in the air. I was no longer safe. Well, "safe". But I didn't feel afraid, no, I was excited. It was just a game, after all, and I just got my first weapon. It was time to kick some ass. A waypoint appeared on my HUD. "Escape" 1km distant. The hell is that in american?

"Escape" 0.6mi.

Thank you. I've never had a game react to my bitching in real time before. Best game ever, ten out of ten.

"Hurry" 0.6mi.

I'll get there when I get there! FUCK!

"leaving in 10mins if you're here or not" 0.6mi.

Fine. I'll be there. I left the storage closet. I was no longer alone.

A swarm of lizard guys in tactical gear were in my way. I fucked them up.

You want me to describe it to you? It was kickass as fuck. If I ever learn how to animate models in blender, this is one of the first scenes Imma remake. For now, use your imagination. I believe in you.

I eventually made my way to a hanger.

It wasn't hard to determine which ship the waypoint was directing me towards, and I wasn't the only one running to it. There were others, some naked, others wearing togas like mine, all armed with makeshift weapons. One had a rifle, I assumed taken from a lizard guy. Why didn't I take a gun? I love guns. I guess I was too busy smashing fuckers with a pipe to think about it.

Not everyone made it aboard. More lizard guys showed up and shot down some escapees. Myself and twelve others made it. At the time I wasn't sure if the others were human or not. I guessed it didn't really matter. We survived... whatever that was.

Actually, what the fuck was that? And what next?

At least it's not a level zero anymore.
