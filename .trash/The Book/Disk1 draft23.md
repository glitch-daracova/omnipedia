*Recorder is on, you may begin when ready.*
<p style="text-align:justify">
Every hero has an origin story, but this isn't a comic. Events happened, and this is an attempt to record those events. It may seem as fiction to you, who is now likely reading this on Earth in the early 20th century. The Earth I am from, we didn't call it Earth and the 20th century had long passed.</p>

*How long have you been preparing that line? You delivered it well.*
<p style="text-align:justify">
Some version of it for the past handful of years. I appreciate you doing this for me, Madelyn. I know this isn't really in your job description.
</p>

*Nonsense, anything for you. I'm just surprised you didn't ask Taura.*
<p style="text-align:justify">
Yeah, I tried bringing her in on this project last year. She's better for hands-on kind of tasks.
</p>

*Meaning you two couldn't stop fucking long enough to write a few pages?*
<p style="text-align:justify">
Like rabbits, uh, no offense.
</p>

*Please, I know what I am. Besides, you know she comes to me when you're not around.*
<p style="text-align:justify">
Of course I know. You know that I encouraged her to do so. ... You're going to edit this out, right?
</p>

*Of course, boss.*
<p style="text-align:justify">
Let's get back to it.
</p>

*Alright then. Who are you, and where are you from?*
<p style="text-align:justify">
I am Glitch Daracova. That's not the name my father gave me, of course. It is, however, what I call myself in my mind. I was born on Terra, 29th of August, 87NA. I can't tell you how far into the future for you 87NA actually is, because we lost count of years sometime after the Ark left in 2091CE.
</p>

*What was Terra like in those days?*
<p style="text-align:justify">
Terra was the rotting corpse of a once-alive planet. A small portion of it known as Texas was where I called home. I can't speak for other parts of the world, but around there people just got on with their lives. The details might have been different from what you'd likely expect. Acid rain was normal; we just called it rain. Zombies were a daily nuisance; don't leave home without a stick. If you still had your life at the end of the day, it was time to Dream your other one.
</p>

*What do you mean, "Dream"?*
<p style="text-align:justify">
The Dream is like full-dive virtual reality. As soon as you fall asleep, you're in it.
