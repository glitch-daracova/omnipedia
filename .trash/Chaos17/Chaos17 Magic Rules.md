# Magic Rules
Return to [[ChaosisEternal/Chaos17/Chaos17 Home]].

_In order to be compliant with the K.I.S.S. protocol, magic is getting revised again. Significant changes include removal of “pact magic”, as having two different rule sets for magic just over complicates it unnecessarily. Spellcasting is renamed to “Magic”, but largely remains the same._

Regardless of what means you use to acquire magic, the rules to use it are the same. Whether you have fire powers, psionics, ki, spellcasting, nanotech, it doesn’t matter as those terms just describe the theme of your magic.

I don’t care about how many spells you know (nor do I care if you call them spells or something else), so long as it makes sense for your character. No class restrictions.

**No matter what, you can only cast one spell on your turn.** This does not prevent you from casting a spell as a reaction, as you perform your reaction during another character’s turn.

# Mana Reworked AGAIN

_Less figuring out what you’re doing, more doing it. Revisions will make magic faster and easier._

### Max Mana = Brains+Proficiency

Mana is a resource used to cast spells. Depending on your character’s theme, you might call your mana something else, I don’t care. You have an amount of mana equal to your Brains plus your Proficiency Bonus. Whenever you cast a spell, you use one mana. The potency of that spell (should a number be needed) is equal to your Brains.

If you are a greater caster (such as a wizard, warlock, sorcerer, cleric, druid, or equivalent), then certain spell effects can be considered “default” and do not cost mana. These are:

-   Mage Armor
    -   Only works if you’re not wearing real armor. Describe it however you want.
    -   Add your Brains to your AC. There is no initiative penalty.
-   Conjured Weapons
    -   Create a melee or ranged weapon that uses your Brains as the ATK value. You will still use Might or Skill as the stat for the attack roll.
    -   1d20 + (Might OR Skill) + Brains + Proficiency
-   Basic Spell Attacks
    -   Blast shit with magical energies that make sense for you.
    -   1d20 + 2xBrains + Proficiency

~~Mana is a resource used to cast spells. Depending on your character’s theme, you might call your mana something else, I don’t care. You have an amount of mana equal to your Brains multiplied by your Proficiency Bonus (if you have zero brains, you have zero mana regardless of what feats or abilities you have).~~

~~To cast a spell, you can spend an amount of mana no greater than your Brains. Make up whatever the hell kind of effect that you want (within reason) and it will (probably) happen.~~

~~If you’re casting a spell that does damage, it counts as an attack. The relevant stat is Brains, and the ATK value is the amount of mana spent (also add your proficiency bonus).~~

~~If you’re casting a spell that causes any other effect, it counts as an action. The amount of mana spent will determine how powerful/effective the spell is. The DM will use his best judgement on how to handle the result.~~
