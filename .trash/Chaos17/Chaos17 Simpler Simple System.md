This is taken from the shared document "Proposition for Jacob's Run" and the old "Fate-Esque Simple System" document. Hopefully, I've improved the readability of it.

# The Fundamentals

Do note that all rules come with the stipulation of “Within Reason” which is entirely up to the DM’s judgement and subject to change without notice.

## Your Sheet

There's a very small amount of numbers that you need to keep track of, in the name of simplicity.

Your Character Level. A party that adventures together levels together. All members of a party should be the same level.

Your Power Bonus, or PB. This number is equal to your Character Level, and will be added to most rolls.

Your Health and Mana counts. Health is used to not die. Mana is used to do cool shit. The two added together should equal your Character Level.

Your Traits and Equipment may also have numbers attached to them. While these numbers won't be used directly (some exceptions apply), they should influence how you decide to approach a situation.

## Performing an Action

Whenever you want to do a thing, you must describe your action with two sentences. The first is a Declaration of Intent. This is what you want to accomplish, your immediate goal. The second is a Plan of Action. This is how you intend to accomplish your goal, the means to your ends.

A Declaration of Intent should never contain the word “and”. There should only be one purpose to your Declaration of Intent. This is how the maximum extent of your action can be.

A Plan of Action can be as long as you want, but longer and more convoluted plans are more likely to fail. This is especially true in combat or any situation where you have limited time to enact your plan.

### Making an Attack

Because that's usually what you'll be doing.

Most of the time, this formula will be used:

> **( [ActionRoll] + [Bonuses] ) x [Multipliers] = [Total]**

In this context:

-   [ActionRoll] is a number produced by a 1d20 roll.
    -   Remember that in the event of a natural 20 (or crit), attacks are automatically successful, damage is doubled, no Counter Roll is made, and no reaction is possible.
    -   In the event of a natural 1 (or crit fail), attacks automatically fail, no damage is dealt, no Counter Roll is made, and the target gets a free reaction.
-   [Bonuses] is your Power Bonus (or PB), plus any applicable buffs and situational advantages.
-   [Multipliers] are things like Multistrike or Shadow Clones. Extra mana burned also adds to this number.
    -   Note: Use of multiple weapons counts as Multistrike, +1 for each additional weapon.
-   [Total] is what you get after completing this formula. This may be a very large number, bigger is of course better.

Whenever you attack something that doesn't automatically die in one hit, the target will contest your attack. The DM will Counter Roll your original [ActionRoll] number.

-   If the Counter Roll is greater than the [ActionRoll] (matching is not good enough), then the target takes half of the [Total] as Damage and gets a free reaction.
-   If the Counter Roll matches or is less than the original [Action Roll], then the target takes the full [Total] as damage, and we move on.
-   Counter Rolls cannot crit nor crit fail (Natural 20s and Natural 1s on counter rolls don't matter).

### Making Other Actions

Sometimes, dealing damage is not what you want to do.

## Getting Attacked and How to Respond

Whenever an enemy attacks you, the DM will act in a similar but not identical way to a party member attacking an enemy. Instead, this formula will be used:

> **[ActionRoll] + [Bonuses] = [Total]**

In this context:

-   [ActionRoll] is a number produced by a 1d20 roll.
    -   Remember that in the event of a natural 20 (or crit), any damage dealt is doubled.
    -   In the event of a natural 1 (crit fail), the attack automatically fails and no damage is dealt.
-   [Bonuses] the Power Bonus of the enemy plus any situation advantages it may have.
    -   A chart showing recommended [Bonuses] values is included at the bottom of this page.
-   There are no [Multipliers], because the party wouldn't stand a chance.
-   [Total] is the end result of this formula.

In order to do damage, the enemy's [Total] must exceed it's target's Power Bonus plus any defensive buffs and situation advantages that are applicable. Damage dealt is equal to whatever the attacking roll beat your defense by.

You can, however, spend your reaction to mitigate damage. Roll 1d20 and add mana (if you so choose). Reduce damage taken by this number.

## Traits and Equipment

For the most part, traits and equipment should inform your decisions on what to do, rather than giving you direct numerical power. There are some exceptions, however.

-   Super Forms, when used, increase your [Bonuses] like a buff.
-   Using things that a target is weak against provides Situational Advantages and thus improves your [Bonuses].
-   Some traits and equipment have Multistrike or similar attributes that improve your [Multipliers]. Sometimes it will be a flat number, other times it will be a 1d20 roll.
