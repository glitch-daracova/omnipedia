# The Fundamentals

Do note that all rules come with the stipulation of "Within Reason" which is entirely up to the DM's judgement and subject to change without notice.

## Intent and Action.

Whenever you want to do a thing, you must describe your action with two sentences. The first is a Declaration of Intent. This is what you want to accomplish, your immediate goal. The second is a Plan of Action. This is how you intend to accomplish your goal, the means to your ends.

A Declaration of Intent should never contain the word "and". There should only be one purpose to your Declaration of Intent. This is how the maximum extent of your action can be.

A Plan of Action can be as long as you want, but longer and more convoluted plans are more likely to fail. This is especially true in combat or any situation where you have limited time to enact your plan.

## Roll Once and Be Done.

After stating your Declaration of Intent and your Plan of Action, you figure out what bonuses are going to be added to your roll. You add your Proficiency Bonus for each trait, feat, skill, item, or situational advantage that is relevant to the current roll. Yes, they stack. This single roll applies to the entirety of your action, and how successful (or unsuccessful) you are.

You cannot add bonuses after the die is cast.

If the total roll is high enough, your Declared Intent happens, regardless of how you actually did it.

## Response and Reaction

This system does not have static numbers for armor class, nor does it call for saving throws. Instead, whenever an action is taken against you (regardless of if this action is performed by a creature or object), you counter-roll the action. You may add whatever bonuses (traits, items, situational advantages, etc) that you and the DM agree are relevant to the action you are trying to not be affected by.

Also, once per round you can use a Reaction to actively do something about an action that affects you, or to influence the outcome of another action you are witnessing.

## You are your traits.

And your traits are a big deal. Anyone can cook, but if you label yourself as a chef then you make the best damn food in the whole realm. Anyone can swing a sword, but if you call yourself a swordsman then you could beat five men at once with your main hand tied behind your back you're so damn good. Every half-bit "mage" knows prestidigitation, but if you are a spellcaster, then you wield powers that would make any lesser man tremble. Anyone can be fat and hairy, but if you take fat and hairy as traits, then you are the fattest and hairiest person alive.

You get the idea.

Traits should not require descriptions, they should be self-explanatory from the name alone. If a trait does require a description, it should make sense as if a character in the world where saying it. Traits should not provide rules that need to be remembered, nor should they refer to the ruleset in any way.

## Only Four Numbers to Keep Track of.

Because simplicity.

You have a number of points equal to your character's level to distribute between Health and Mana. Health is spent to save yourself from dying. Mana is spent to do cool shit.

You have a Proficiency Bonus equal to two more than a quarter of your level. Or "PB=(Lvl/4)+2". Whenever a trait, item, or situational advantage can benefit you on a roll, add your Proficiency Bonus for each one.
