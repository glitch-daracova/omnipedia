# Equipment Rules
Return to [[ChaosisEternal/Chaos17/Chaos17 Home]].

If you are creating a new character, choose three weapons, or two weapons and a shield. No class restrictions. Then pick out some armor. Your DM will give you the particulars about your chosen gear, but you’ll be able to get a feel for what to expect using the guidelines explained below.

All weapons have an ATK (attack) value. This number is used for attack rolls and damage calculation as described in the Combat Rules section of this page.

All armor have an Armor Value and an Armor Penalty, which are used in the following calculations respectively.

You have an Armor Class, which is determined by adding your Skill to your Armor Value.

You have an Initiative Bonus, which is determined by subtracting your Armor Penalty from your Proficiency Bonus. Your Initiative Bonus can be negative if your armor is particularly cumbersome.

Equipment descriptions will be on their own page.

# Basic Weapon Guidelines

This list is a breakdown of SWORDS. All other weapons can be determined on comparison.

ATK+1 – Dagger (one handed, concealable)

ATK+2 – Short Sword & Arming Sword (one handed, sidearm)

ATK+3 – Bastard Sword & Longsword (two handed, sidearm)

ATK+4 – Greatsword (two handed, primary)

Special and Rare weapons have an additional +2 to ATK.

Legendary weapons and Soultekk weapons have an additional +4 to ATK.

# Basic Armor Guidelines

Clothing has an Armor Value of zero and an Armor Penalty of zero.

Light Armor has an Armor Value of 12 and an Armor Penalty of  3.

Medium Armor has an Armor Value of 14 and an Armor Penalty of 6.

Heavy Armor has an Armor Value of 16 and an Armor Penalty of 9.

Shields have an Armor Value of 1 and an Armor Penalty of 1.

If your armor is Special or Rare, raise your Armor Value by 2.

If your armor is Legendary or Soultekk, raise your Armor Value by 4.

# Magic Item Guidelines

To use a magical item’s special properties, you must be attuned to it. Attuning a magic item to yourself binds it to you, although what that actually means may vary from item to item.

All magic items draw from the same pool of uses, which has a maximum number equal to your Proficiency Bonus. Wands, stacks of scrolls, potion belts, etc. all fall into this category. If the effect needs a number, be it for a roll or DC or whatever, use your Proficiency Bonus.

Soultekk armor provides a passive bonus of extra Hearts equal to your Proficiency Bonus.
