~~New with v6: Now includes a cheat sheet so you don’t have to reference this page as much.~~

~~**WARNING! The cheat sheet attached to the character sheet is currently WRONG! It will be fixed with v7.**~~

## Who are you, and what do you do?

Your name, your title, your race, your class description, kingdom of origin. All that shit. This is all thematic and I don’t care what you do with it (within reason).

## Allocate your Stats

Ask your DM what level you will be starting at. You have a number of stat points equal to your character level to distribute between the three stats: Might, Skill, and Brains. Whenever you make an ability check, saving throw, or attack roll, you will be adding that stat number to the roll.

## Other Important Numbers

Your AC (armor class) is the number that an enemy must roll in order to hit you with an attack. You can determine your AC by adding your skill stat to Armor Value of your equipped armor. See the equipment section for details.

Your Initiative value is a bonus added on to your Initiative Roll (how turn order is determined when in combat and similar situations). You can determine your AC by subtracting the Armor Penalty of your equipped armor from your Proficiency Bonus. Your initiative bonus can be negative if your armor is particularly cumbersome.

You also have a Proficiency Bonus which can be determined by adding two to one quarter of your character level. This proficiency bonus is used in a number of different calculations, and can be applied to any roll related to things you’re good at (if you’re good at hitting things, then add your proficiency to your attack rolls).

## The Heart Meter

~~_Changed because doing division in the middle of combat is a fucking awful idea. New character sheets won’t be a thing until I’ve finished revising the system, so the graphic is going to be wrong for a while. Also, I know people hate redoing character sheets._~~

_Reverting previous change because of other systems I really like being dependent upon the heart system having, well, hearts._

Your Heart Meter is a combined representation of your character’s general health, damage taken, fatigue, and luck. The large space in the middle is for your current number of full hearts. When you have zero hearts remaining, you die.

### Maximum Hearts = Might+Level

You have a maximum number of hearts equal to your Might plus your Character Level. Put this number in the upper section of the heart meter.

### Resistance = (Might/4)+Proficiency

Each heart can withstand an amount of damage equal to one quarter of your Might (rounded down) plus your Proficiency Bonus before becoming depleted. Put this damage resistance number in the lower section of the heart meter.
