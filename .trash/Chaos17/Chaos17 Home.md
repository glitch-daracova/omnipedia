# Chaos Custom Ruleset v17
## The KISS Overhaul
**This incomplete system is no longer being used, and is retained for reference only. Go to Chaos19 Home instead.**

I'm currently working on changes that will not go into effect until after the current mission is over at the earliest. Between now and then, the reference is going to be a bit unreliable (not that we really need it currently, but still).

Note: I will frequently use phrases like "within reason" or "so long as it makes sense" within this document. When determining whether or not something makes sense or is within reason, the only person who's opinion matters is that of the DM. **If the DM changes his mind, forgets, or is otherwise inconsistent, the most recent ruling stands.**

_System is getting a new revision as of 7-11-'17. Some things are getting reworked because they're either more complicated than they need to be, or the way I described them is confusing, or both. You can see the changes here as I come up with them, but I won't be enforcing the changes until I'm happy with them._

# Introduction

First things first, you should read the introduction section to the [DnD5e Player's Basic Rules](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules). It's only four pages, and it spells out general rules perfectly. I'll get around to paraphrasing it in such a way that it doesn't look like I'm plagiarizing later.

# [[ChaosisEternal/Chaos17/Chaos17 Character Creation]]

This section deals with how to make your character sheet, and how to determine all the important numbers you will need to keep track of on it.
