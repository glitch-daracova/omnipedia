# Initiative

When rolling for initiative at the beginning of an encounter, add your initiative bonus to that roll. Highest numbers go first.

On your turn, you can do ONE action, and move a short distance (in any order). Usually, your one action will be an attack.

When it is not your turn, you can make a reaction in response to another character’s action. You can only do this once per round.

# Attacking

### Number of Attacks = 1+(Might/4)

Normally, you can attack once as an action. You gain an extra attack for every four points of Might.

### Explaining a couple of things…

If a spell does damage, it counts as an attack rather than an action (regardless, you can still only cast one spell on your turn).

Melee weapon attacks are based on Might. Ranged weapon attacks are based on Skill. Spell attacks are based on Brains.

All weapon attacks have an ATK value which can be found in the item’s description. Spell attacks and conjured weapons have an ATK value equal to your brains.

### To Hit = 1d20+stat+proficiency+ATKvalue

_Your To Hit bonus and your Damage number are now the same number. I’m still working on a good name for this. Hit Bonus?_

For a normal, single target attack, roll 1d20, add the appropriate stat, your proficiency bonus, and the ATK value of the weapon. If the total result is equal to or greater than the target’s AC, you hit and deal 3 hearts of damage, with extra damage for every 5 points the attack roll exceeds the target’s AC.

On CRIT (the result shown on the d20 is a 20), the attack automatically hits regardless of the target’s AC and deals an amount of damage equal to DOUBLE your total roll.

# Special Attacks

Sometimes, depending on the situation, you can do cool shit instead of a normal attack.

### Disarm your Opponent

Make an attack roll like normal. On hit, instead of doing damage, the target must make a save to hold on to his weapon (save DC = your attack roll).

### AOE

Instead of making an attack roll, all targets in range must make a save (save DC = weapon’s ATK value + the appropriate stat + proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the targets take 2 hearts of damage. On a successful save, targets take 1 heart of damage, if applicable.

### Heavy Attack

This is a powerful strike that is tiring to perform. Expend one FULL HEART (because fatigue) and make an attack roll as normal. On hit, deal double damage. If this attack crits, double the damage again.

Shove, trip, grapple, whatever. Did I miss something?
