## The Design Philosophy
The Chaos Core Ruleset (CCR) is a tabletop RPG using cards to build and play your character. The focus of the ruleset is to kill monsters, explore dungeons, and get loot.

CCR is NOT setting agnostic. While it is true that anything can be reflavored to fit, this ruleset is designed specifically to support games set in Erewhon and the Chaos Multiverse. For example, there will be no generic "human" or "dwarf" races, instead all races will be named based on where they came from or what they call themselves.
## The Story So Far

## Basic Rules
### The Character Sheet
Every character has a character sheet, and what's on that character sheet details everything you need to know about your character in the context of Chaos as a game.
#### Name
Who are you? This can be whatever you want, so long as it's not offensive by the sensibilities of your GM or fellow players.
#### Race / Title / Religion
What are you, how are you known, and who's your god? Each of these choices will add cards to your deck.

Do bear in mind that these will never be complete lists. For the most part, I'll be fleshing out the lists on an as-needed basis.
#### Backstory
What did you do? This isn't season one of a tv show, we're on season five (or whatever). Everyone here has already had their origin story and saved (or doomed) their home kingdom. Now, the stakes are higher than ever (what were those cows eating? magic mushrooms?)
### Combat
The main event. The core gameplay loop. This is what you're here for.
#### At the start of combat
Ensure all cards are in their correct starting positions. Shuffle your main deck and set it on your left. You need not shuffle your side deck. If multiple cards begin in your discard pile, shuffle that as well.
