Given that so much has happened over the past LITTERAL DECADE, here's a recap of how we got here. Do bear in mind that some things are being retconned, either because of game/lore breaking reasons or I simply don't remember exactly how it happened.

## The Main Party - Just the Overview
### Year One, people arrive in Erewhon
Many characters are introduced, usually around the town of Old Sorpigal.

Gathered together in the town of Old Sorpigal. Specific names came and went, but the influential characters were Jasmeuri the Vampire, Kane the Veteran, Masu the Wizard, Kai the Demon, Serena the Dragonborn.
Together, the party rallied the common people of Einroth and overthrew the Iron Clan's ruling nobility. Serena was installed as the new monarch.

The party's reign was cut short when they discovered that the former King Eisenfoust had made deals with a far off empire, and that empire expected deals to continue regardless of who ruled Einroth.

Armies from the Empire of Phobos swept across Einroth and into the surrounding kingdoms. After little more than a week, all the kingdoms fell under Phobean rule. It shouldn't have been any surprise, plate armor stood little chance against fire from plasma cannons.

A year later, Alzeal the White Angel returned to Einroth and found the state of affairs quite unsatisfactory. He gathered a party of adventurers (the ones listed before and a few others), tasking them with forming a resistance to imperial occupation, and gave them resources that would aid in the quest.

Much of the resources was simply information. Locations of old allies captured by the enemy. Names of future allies and how to persuade them to the cause. Most important was the ability to use the enemy's weapons against them.

At this point, the party split into two main forces:

Kane and friends once again rallied the people of Einroth, this time against the Empire of Phobos.

Jasmeuri and her team liberated the nearby kingdom of Fretalia, using forged patents of nobility to proclaim herself the new rightful queen of the land.

Knowing that this victory was merely temporary, Alzael appeared to the party for the second time. Phobos had nearly infinite armies that they could send as reinforcements, and send they would. In this brief window, Kane and friends would go to the Phobean mainland to assassinate the emperor Kaiser Phobos himself. Jasmeuri and her team would hold the ground gained here, and work to liberate the other kingdoms.

It took another year for Kane and friends to travel from Einroth to Phobos, meanwhile Jasmeuri's tactical abilities were put to the test at home. Kane and friends were eventually successful. In his dying moments, the emperor Kaiser Phobos spoke a prophecy of doom and anointed his killer the new emperor. Thus, Kai the Demon became Kaiser Kai, God of Fear. Kane and friends, minus Kai, returned to Einroth. Also, Alzael stole the sword used to kill Kaiser Phobos, and nobody knows what happened to it (actually, we do know, but that's later).

A year after the death of the old emperor of Phobos, the new emperor of Phobos was kidnapped. Calls for aid were sent to Kai's allies, Kane and friends. Answering the call was Zalazan the Bladedancer, Zylo the Pyromancer, Hiro Himata, and a few others who came and went.

Turns out, Kai was part of a family of demigods created by Gabrael the Purple Angel, and the House Yakobe wanted their wayward brother back. The party traveled to the Land of Dreams to rescue Kai, and along the way freed the godly house from the corrupting grasp of a ghost of evils past. As reward, Zalazan was cured of his undeadness, Zylo freed of his blood-bond to an insane god, and Hiro purified of vampirism. The House Yakobe would become powerful allies.

Allies that would be needed when a rival godly house, the House Athetos decided that House Yakobe would look better as a crater in the ground.
