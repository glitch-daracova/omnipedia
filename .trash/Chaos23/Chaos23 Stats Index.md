You have a number of core stats.

**HP** or Heart Points.
HP is used to not die.
Your maximum HP is determined by this simple formula:
`(Might รท 2)+(Vitality ร 2)`
You lose HP by taking damage. You can regain some HP by resting at a rest site, or by using healing cards. You automatically regain all lost HP when you return to town.
If this number ever hits zero, you die.

**AP** or Action Points.
AP is used to play cards, and is refreshed at the beginning of your turn. You start with 3 maximum AP.

**Might**
Your physical strength. Damage for attacks that rely on might is increased by 1 for every 10 points of might. When you roll a d20 for a might check, the same bonus applies.

**Skill**
Your dexterity, coordination, and balance. Damage for attacks that rely on skill is increased by 1 for every 10 points of skill. When you roll a d20 for a skill check, the same bonus applies. 

**Vitality**
Your health, endurance, and resistance. There are no attacks which rely on vitality. When you roll a d20 for a vitality check, improve your roll by 1 for every 10 points of vitality.

**Brains**
Your intelligence, wisdom, perception, and willpower. 
Damage for attacks that rely on brains is increased by 1 for every 10 points of brains. When you roll a d20 for a brains check, the same bonus applies.
