@everyone I am rebuilding my ruleset for the rpg. Once it's in a playable state, what happens will be canon to lore. I've rewritten a short version of the Old Lore so that anyone who wasn't around from the start can be brought up to speed.
# The New Lore in a Nutshell
Given that so much has happened over the past LITTERAL DECADE, here's a recap of how we got here. Do bear in mind that some things are left out. Other things are retconned. Sometimes I don't remember things how they happened in session. Sometimes what happened in session shouldn't have happened. Sometimes things happened out of session that shouldn't have happened. This is an attempt to clean up the continuity so it's consistent and understandable. This is the New Lore in a Nutshell.

## The Beginning

The year was 1014 of the Fourth Age. The six kingdoms of Agraria where at peace.

That is to say, they were not actively at war with each other, nor was there any cataclysm threatening to end the world. Peace, however, was not peaceful.

In the Free and Independent City States of Olympia (more commonly called 'Former Olympia'), civil inequality was the cause of near constant riots. Almost every city was in their own version of Martial Law.

In Fretalia, humans and elves bickered over the growth of cities versus the preservation of the forests.

In Rodinia, the Crimson Guard held the eastern border against the unrelenting tide of orks that wanted nothing less than to ravage civilization. Everything that kingdom had went to that effort, to the detriment of their own people.

In Greater Anglica, a plague ravaged the countryside. The island was cut off from all trade and travel by the other kingdoms (they would be fine in a few years).

In Einroth, the dwarf clans captured people of other races, and sold them as slaves to the empire across the sea.

In Jarlheim, warriors of great renown where bored stiff.

## The Party Gathers in Erewhon
The town of Old Sorpigal was located on the southern coast of Einroth, and the local tavern saw many adventuring parties come and go. None would be as ... influential as the self-proclaimed "Heroes of Erewhon".

Kane was a mercenary from southern Arechia, beyond the endless deserts. An old veteran of many wars.

"Legless" Jack was a ranger with tremendously bad luck and little regard for anyone not his friends. The only person he really cared about was:

Jasmeuri, Jack's sister and moral compass, was an accomplished mage and martial artist. Don't tell anyone, but she's also a vampire.

Sora was a sorcerer with a natural talent for lightning, mysterious past, and a strange concern for:

Kai was a sorcerer constantly wrestling with a literal demon inside himself. Although he couldn't go anywhere alone due toÂ  being trapped in a crystal prison held by:

Masu was a tiny wizard of immense power, hailing from a realm beyond.

Dex, a Dunfey from the belowrealms under Agraria. Unhappy with what little standing he could acquire in the Dunfey Matriarchy, he sought his fortune on the surface. Best friends with:

Ed, an awakened horse who accompanied Dex on many adventures thus far.

Serena Dragonsdottir, allegedly the adoptive child of the dragon god Bahamut. Strong of heart, but dim of mind.

These were the names who brought ruin upon the six kingdoms of Agraria. Not all were present from the start, and many only contributed for a short time. In their wisdom, they rallied the dwarves of Einroth to rebel against their clan lords. Specifically, the Stormlord, Baron Valdemar in Brinstar.

Brinstar was a shining city on the eastern coast of Einroth, ruled by the Storm Clan and their Baron Valdemar. Everything changed when our party of "heros" marched on the Baron's palace, backed by a mob of angry common dwarves. No one knows what was spoken of within the palace, but the Baron fled for his life (and was later found dead out in the countryside), leaving a group of unproven adventurers to wrestle the city into a new order.

Soon after, a messenger from the Empire arrived asking why trade had ceased. The adventurers told the messenger to fuck off, and off he went. In response, the Empire sent an army. The City of Brinstar was raised to the ground. Forces from the Empire of Phobos swept across Einroth and into the surrounding kingdoms. After little more than a week, all the kingdoms fell under Phobean rule. It shouldn't have been any surprise, plate armor stood little chance against fire from plasma cannons.

The "heroes" responsible were presumed dead.

But it was not the case. They escaped (mostly), but where scattered.

## Resisting the Empire of Phobos
A year later, in 1015 of the Fourth Age, Alzeal Shadesmith returned to Einroth and found the state of affairs quite unsatisfactory. He gathered a party of adventurers (mostly the ones listed before and a few others), tasking them with forming a resistance to imperial occupation, and gave them resources that would aid in the quest.

Much of the resources was simply information. Locations of old allies captured by the enemy. Names of future allies and how to persuade them to the cause. Most important was the ability to use the enemy's weapons against them.

At this point, the party split into two main forces:

Kane and friends once again rallied the people of Einroth, this time against the Empire of Phobos.

Jasmeuri and her team liberated the nearby kingdom of Fretalia, using forged patents of nobility to proclaim herself the new rightful queen of the land.

Knowing that this victory was merely temporary, Alzael appeared to the party for the second time. Phobos had nearly infinite forces that they could send as reinforcements, and send they would. In this brief window, Kane and friends would go to the Phobean mainland to assassinate the emperor Kaiser Phobos himself. Jasmeuri and her team would hold the ground gained here, and work to liberate the other kingdoms.

It was 1018 by the time Kane and friends arrived in Phobos. All the while, Jasmeuri's tactical abilities were put to the test at home. Kane and friends were eventually successful. In his dying moments, the emperor Kaiser Phobos spoke a prophecy of doom and anointed his killer the new emperor. Thus, Kai became Kaiser Kai, God of Fear. Kane and friends, minus Kai, returned to Einroth to be hailed as true heroes. Also, Alzael stole the sword used to kill Kaiser Phobos, and nobody knows what happened to it (actually, we do know, but that's later).

## House Yakobe and the Land of Dreams
Another year passed. It was now 1018 of the Fourth Age. The new Emperor of Phobos had been kidnapped. Calls for aid were sent to Kai's allies, Kane and friends. Answering the call was Zalazan the Bladedancer, Zylo the Pyromancer, Hiro Himata.

Zalazan was a cursed bladedancer, forever tormented by past sins.

Zylo was a pyromancyer forged by an insane god, now searching for a way to kill his master.

Hiro Himata was still a child vampire and accomplished martial artist.

Turns out, Kai was part of a family of demigods created by Gabrael Shadesmith, and the House Yakobe wanted their wayward brother back. Sora had been on a secret mission the whole time to bring Kai back to the fold. The party traveled to the Land of Dreams to rescue Kai, and along the way freed the godly house from the corrupting grasp of a ghost of evils past. As reward, Zalazan was cured of his undeadness, Zylo freed of his blood-bond to an insane god, and Hiro purified of vampirism. The House Yakobe would become powerful allies for battles to come.

In the meantime, the party went their separate ways.

## House Athetos and the War of the Gods
It is now 1023 of the Fourth Age, and it is your turn to be heroes. Many of you will die, but that's a sacrifice necessary to make. The Gods of your Dreams call upon you heroes to fight against the Nightmare that is Athetos. Will you answer the call?

(the new ruleset is NOT ready, by the way.)

## But wait! you skipped so much! What about
The Shadesmith Family
The Empire of the Darkness Flame
The adventure in Mosgrove and the world reverse
The Pinnacle, the Pit, and the Wars Between
Who makes up the House Yakobe
Who makes up the House Athetos
The Fleet Paladin and their Crusade 
so much stuff left out

What about all that, huh?!?!?

I'm only one guy. I'll get there, eventually. I am taking suggestions on how to better document what's happened, so that events aren't forgotten.
