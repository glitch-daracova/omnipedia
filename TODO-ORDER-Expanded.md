### **ORDER as an Organization**

**ORDER** is an enigmatic and powerful organization established to protect the **multiverse** from threats that could disrupt its stability. Founded by **Glitch Daracova** after the Chaos Age and the collapse of the Galactic Republic, ORDER has evolved into a multiverse-spanning intelligence agency dedicated to safeguarding reality itself.

The organization is known for recruiting individuals from all walks of life, including condemned criminals given second chances as **No Profound Class (NPC)** personnel. ORDER provides opportunities for education, personal growth, and skill development, fostering a structured, disciplined community loyal to ORDER’s mission. With its vast resources and advanced technologies, ORDER maintains a careful balance between diplomacy and enforcement across various realms, navigating complex alliances and inter-realm politics to ensure the multiverse remains stable.

2. **The Afterlife4**  
   - A **super-dreadnought** operating within the chaotic realm of the Breach, Afterlife4 is ORDER’s largest mobile hub, designed to function entirely within the Breach. Equipped with multiple **Vargas Field generators** to shield against Breachfire, Afterlife4 acts as a base of operations for cross-realm missions and a refueling station for other ORDER ships. Overseer **Michael Shadesmith** commands this vessel, maintaining ORDER’s presence within the Breach and managing sensitive inter-realm operations.

3. **Site 42**  
   - Directed by **Doctor Leo**, Site 42 is ORDER’s high-security containment facility, tasked with neutralizing or incarcerating high-risk threats to the multiverse. It houses dangerous entities and failed experiments, including some of **Seth Shadesmith’s corrupt progeny**. The facility also hosts **Project Iceman**, an ongoing research initiative attempting to replicate nano-augmented abilities similar to **cryozyme** without the accompanying madness. Doctor Leo’s strict protocols and classified research define Site 42 as one of ORDER’s most secure and secretive installations.

4. **Vulka’s Workshop**

It is staffed by ORDER’s elite **Ferros Engineers**, who complete contracts under extreme conditions. The Workshop produces hexagrammic weapons for supernatural containment and supplies critical resources to other ORDER facilities, maintaining operational self-sufficiency in the resource-rich realm of Ferro_nyx.
