# The Nature of Divinity
> See Also [[GodKingsAndKingsOfGods]]

Divinity in the multiverse is a complex and multifaceted force, rooted in both **metaphysical principles** and the **faith of mortals**. Gods are beings who possess the **spark of divinity**, an essence that grants them unparalleled power, immortality, and influence over the realms and domains they govern. However, divinity is not absolute; it is shaped, sustained, and sometimes constrained by the very mortals who revere these gods.

### Origins of Divinity

The spark of divinity may be attained through various means:

1. **Traditional Gods**: Manifestations of ideals or natural forces brought to life through collective belief.
2. **Demigods**: Offspring of gods and mortals who inherit fragments of divine power.
3. **Uplifted Mortals**: Mortals who are granted divinity by existing gods through boons, artifacts, or rituals.
4. **Faith-Fueled Ascension**: Individuals elevated to godhood by the fervent devotion of others, becoming living deities.
5. **Conquest of Divinity**: Mortals who kill gods and take their power, claiming their spark for themselves.

### The Role of Belief

Faith is the lifeblood of divinity, granting power to gods while also binding them to the expectations of their followers. The nature of a god is directly influenced by the beliefs, rituals, and perceptions of mortals.

- **Strength in Numbers**: More followers mean greater power, but also stronger ties to the collective identity defined by their worshipers.
- **Shaping Influence**: Gods evolve with the changing beliefs of their followers, and failure to adapt risks their decline.
- **Control vs. Submission**: Gods who actively manage their domains and engage with their followers can shape their public image, minimizing unwanted changes to their essence.

### Divine Power and Limits

Gods wield immense power, but their influence is not limitless:

- **Domain Authority**: A god’s power is strongest within their domain, which may include abstract concepts (e.g., life, fire) or physical territories.
- **Inter-Realm Influence**: While gods can extend their reach to other realms, their ability to reshape reality is often restricted to their home realm.
- **Vulnerability**: Gods are immortal but not invincible. They can be slain, forgotten, or weakened by loss of faith or divine conflict.

### The Life Cycle of Gods

- **Creation**: Gods may be born of belief, ascend from mortality, or emerge from divine lineage.
- **Growth and Evolution**: As belief strengthens or shifts, gods grow in power and adapt to their followers’ expectations.
- **Decline**: Gods abandoned by their followers or failing to maintain their domain may fade into obscurity or become dormant.
- **Death and Legacy**: The death of a god can leave their spark, domain, or essence to be claimed by another, leading to divine succession or chaos.

### Divine Interaction

- **Relationships with Mortals**: Mortals see gods as protectors, tyrants, or distant forces of nature. Some gods actively interact with mortals, while others remain aloof.
- **Rivalries and Alliances**: Gods often form pantheons, alliances, or rivalries, engaging in conflicts that can reshape realms.
- **Rebellion and Independence**: Mortals who reject gods’ authority can spark upheaval, challenging the divine order.

### The Mystery of Divinity

While many gods believe themselves to be the pinnacle of existence, others ponder the **source of divinity itself**. Are gods the ultimate beings, or are they shaped and constrained by higher laws? Could there be forces beyond even the gods, such as the **Breach**, that define the multiverse’s true nature?
