>**Nanotech** refers to the manipulation of matter at the **nanometer scale**, typically between 1 and 100 nanometers, resulting in **materials**, **mechanisms**, and **technologies** with properties that transcend conventional physical laws. It encompasses the creation and control of **self-replicating nanomachines** and **nanostructures**—often influenced by interactions with the **Breach**—allowing for feats of engineering and biology that were once deemed impossible. In modern usage, nanotech describes any process, phenomenon, or material that derives its function from these nanoscopic forces, which underpin everything from **augmentations** to **interstellar travel**.
