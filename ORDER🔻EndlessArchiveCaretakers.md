### The Caretakers of the Endless Archive

The Endless Archive is managed by an autonomous group of **Caretakers**, each of whom oversees a specific wing with their own unique—and often incompatible—system of organization. While they view one another as equals, each Caretaker maintains strict control over their own domain, allowing only their personally chosen subordinates to work within their sections. Together, they preserve and expand the Archive’s immense collection of knowledge, even if their methods sometimes clash.
