# The Omnipendium
The Omnipendium is established 2024-03-07. It was a Thursday. This document will contain the ruleset for the Chaos LitRPG, as well as a wiki of locations, events, characters, and more.

> Alternative title: *Excerpts from a book I'll never write.*

### What happened to the Grand Compendium of Information?
Good question. The GCOI was full of old, outdated, incomplete, and contradictory information. Much of it will be pulled forward into the Omnipendium, but not without heavy review.

### What is the purpose of this new Omnipendium?

Apart from being a reference for authors, game masters, and players alike, I also intend to eventually train a GPT like AI on the contents of the Omnipedia. I will then use this ai to transform "Excerpts from a book I'll never write" into a book actually written. I don't know how that's going to work yet, but I'll get there when I get there. Do note that before anyone can actually use this reference, I need to figure out how licences work and attach an appropriate one to this body of work.
