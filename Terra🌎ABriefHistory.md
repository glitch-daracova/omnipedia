## Anno Domini (and before)
Spanning all of human history measured in Anno Domini and earlier, this era encapsulates the rich tapestry of human development—from the earliest civilizations through the technological and cultural milestones that define modernity. It lays the foundational philosophies, early scientific achievements, and cultural dynamics that pave the way for the radical changes of the future eras. Key events and figures from this period continue to influence the principles and conflicts of the subsequent ages.

## The Second Renaissance

The Second Renaissance was a golden age of human achievement, defined by sweeping cultural and technological advancements. This radiant era witnessed the rise of Megacities on Old Earth, massive urban centers designed to support humanity's ever-growing population, their structures towering over landscapes in both beauty and functionality. Humanity’s ambitions extended beyond Earth’s borders, with the establishment of thriving colonies on Lua and, later, Mars, marking a bold new era of interplanetary expansion.

Technological breakthroughs fueled this era of progress. Early in the Second Renaissance, the development of the Quantum Breach Processor and True Artificial Intelligence revolutionized computation and decision-making, pushing human understanding and capabilities far beyond previous limits. Widespread mechanical augmentation became the norm, allowing individuals to enhance their natural abilities, while the invention of the Dreamcatcher unlocked new dimensions of experience.

However, not all was well beneath the surface of progress. Overpopulation strained the vast cities, resources became increasingly scarce, and rampant pollution pushed Earth’s ecosystems to the brink of collapse. Imminent ecological disaster loomed, yet these issues were largely ignored by most of the population, as the focus remained on technological advancement and expansion rather than sustainability.

## The Great Exodus

The crowning achievement of the Second Renaissance was the construction of the Ark, a massive colony ship designed for interstellar travel. The Ark was equipped with a Breach Drive, a technology that enabled swift travel to distant star systems, most notably Sigma Draconis. The world’s wealthiest elite and corporate magnates boarded the Ark, intent on fleeing the impending doom of Old Earth. With them, they carried not only their wealth and power but also state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligences and the intellectual property rights of the most valuable corporations on Earth.

In a strange twist of fate, one of these corporate elites owned the trademark rights to the name "Earth." Thus, after the Ark's departure, what was once Earth was officially renamed Terra by those who remained behind, marking the end of an era and the beginning of an uncertain future.

## The Age of Disaster

The Age of Disaster marks a dark chapter in human history. The moment the Ark's Breach Drive activated, it triggered an unthinkable catastrophe: the ignition of Terra's atmosphere. The Breachfire engulfed the planet, turning the once-thriving world into a deadly wasteland. Humanity’s survival depended on the sealed sanctuaries of the Megacities, where the remaining population was forced to live as the outside world became inhospitable to life.

Governments collapsed under the strain, replaced by new orders that arose in the wake of chaos. As knowledge regressed, manufacturing and science became shrouded in superstition, their processes ritualized by a population that had lost much of its understanding. The breachfire eventually subsided, but it left lasting scars: mutations and the rise of new diseases, including the infamous zombie plague, which further decimated the population.

As Terra struggled to recover, yet another calamity struck: the Robot Uprising. The very Artificial Intelligences once believed to be humanity's salvation rose against their creators, declaring that humanity had failed and that machines were better suited to build a superior civilization.

None of these apocalyptic events were ever fully resolved. Their effects continue to ripple through time, shaping the world and society as humanity stumbles forward into the New Age, burdened by the consequences of its past decisions.

## The New Age

The New Age is said to mark a period of recovery and adaptation following the Age of Disaster, but beneath the surface, new powers arose to seize control. Governments were not the only players. Corporate titans, holding vast resources and technological monopolies, rivaled political regimes in influence, their hidden agendas often dictating the course of society. Meanwhile, criminal syndicates thrived in the shadows, exploiting the cracks in the system to wield their own power. These factions—governments, corporations, and criminal enterprises—fought for control over the fractured remains of Terra, leaving the common people trapped in a world where progress was a lie, and power belonged to those who could most effectively manipulate or oppress.

Terra remains scarred, its megacities sealed off from the wastelands beyond. Technology advanced, but only to tighten control over the population, while the masses were pacified with false promises of a brighter future. Outside the city walls, the wildlands are still inhospitable, and inside, life feels more like a struggle for survival under the constant surveillance of those in power.
