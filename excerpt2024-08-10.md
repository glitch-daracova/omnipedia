# The Fall of the God of Corruption

The skies above the battlefield churned with dark, malevolent energy, reflecting the chaos and decay that had overtaken the realm. What was once a world teeming with life had become a twisted, barren wasteland, poisoned by the influence of the god who claimed dominion over it. The very air was thick with the stench of corruption, a foul miasma that choked the life out of everything it touched. Rivers that once ran clear now bubbled with toxic sludge, and the earth itself seemed to rot underfoot.

This was the domain of the god of Corruption, a deity who had twisted his people’s faith into a tool for his own perverse ends. Through his influence, the land had been tainted, its inhabitants enslaved to his will, their souls slowly consumed by the spreading rot of his power. He had banished death from his realm, not out of mercy, but to prolong the suffering, to ensure that his dominion would never end.

But today, his reign of terror was challenged by a force even he could not corrupt—Hadrael Shadesmith, angel of ORDER, and the harbinger of justice.

Hadrael stood amidst the devastation, his form stark against the twisted landscape. Cloaked in an aura of dark, ethereal energy, he was a beacon of unyielding power, his presence a direct contrast to the decay that surrounded him. His wings, vast and shadowy, seemed to draw in the darkness, nullifying the corruption in his immediate vicinity. Sent by his brothers and the organization they all served—ORDER—Hadrael’s mission was clear: to bring this twisted god to justice and cleanse the multiverse of his vile influence.

Before him, the god of Corruption knelt, his once-imposing form now broken and diminished, yet his arrogance remained intact. His body, once a symbol of divine power, was now a grotesque mockery of what it had been, marred by the very corruption he had spread. Black ichor, thick and foul, oozed from deep wounds, seeping into the already tainted earth. Even now, in the face of defeat, his eyes burned with a malevolent pride.

"Yield to me, corruptor of these lands," Hadrael’s voice cut through the fetid air like a blade, cold and commanding. "For I have defeated you in battle. Your strength has failed, your twisted divinity crumbled before my might. For the crimes against your people, your worshipers, and the multiverse itself, you shall face judgment. No longer shall you sit upon your throne of rot, basking in the suffering you have wrought."

The god forced a twisted smile, a hideous parody of defiance. "You… think you have defeated me?" he sneered, his voice a sickly, rasping mockery of its former power. "You, a mere instrument of ORDER, dare to claim victory over a god? I am eternal, invincible! I have banished death from this realm—what power could you possibly wield that can undo what I have created? My corruption is absolute, my dominion unending! I shall live on eternal, bound to these lands as long as they fester. What can you, a mere shadow, do against one who has mastered life, death, and decay?"

Hadrael’s expression remained impassive, his eyes narrowing as he stepped forward. "You misunderstand your situation," he replied, his tone steady, almost indifferent. "Your dominion ends at the borders of your creation, and your arrogance blinds you to the truth. You believe yourself invincible because you have crafted a cage where death does not enter, where corruption festers unchecked. But that cage is your prison, and you are its prisoner."

The god’s eyes flickered with a momentary doubt, quickly masked by rage. "You cannot… No, I am a god! My will is law! The laws of this realm—"

"Your laws hold no power over me," Hadrael interrupted, his voice carrying an edge of finality. "I am not a creature of these lands, nor am I beholden to the rules you have imposed. I am the harbinger of ORDER, the purifier of all that defies it. Your corruption—your crimes against the multiverse—cannot go unanswered. You have twisted the faith of your people, perverted it into a tool of your own glorification, spreading your rot across these lands. But corruption can be cleansed. And today, that cleansing begins with you."

As Hadrael spoke, the air around him began to distort, a rift forming in the fabric of reality itself. A void opened behind him, a place where the laws of this corrupted realm held no sway, where even the most vile and powerful of gods could be brought to their knees. The god’s bravado faltered, his confidence crumbling as he felt the cold pull of the abyss.

"Please… I am necessary… I am the one who brings balance through decay… Without me, this world would stagnate… I am—"

"You are a blight upon existence," Hadrael said, his voice as cold as the void itself. "And now, you will face your judgment."

With those words, Hadrael reached out, his hand closing around the god’s essence. The rift widened, a vortex of darkness and purifying cold that began to draw the god in, his immortality unraveling before his eyes. The god’s scream echoed through the void as he was dragged into the abyss, his power extinguished, his corruption purified by the relentless force of ORDER.

In the aftermath, the battlefield was silent, the oppressive presence of the fallen god dissipating like a noxious vapor burned away by the first light of dawn. The air, once thick with the stench of decay, began to clear, the land itself seeming to breathe a sigh of relief as the corruption was cleansed. Hadrael stood alone, the task complete, his expression unreadable. He had done what was necessary—what his family and ORDER had demanded of him—but there was no triumph in his eyes, only a grim determination.

He turned away from the void, closing it with a thought, and prepared to leave this scarred world behind. The people of this realm would need time to heal, to rebuild in the absence of their corrupt god. And Hadrael—he would return to his brothers, to ORDER, and continue his quest to restore balance to the multiverse, no matter what it cost him.

For this was the path he had chosen, the burden he bore as the angel of ORDER. A path that would see him face countless more battles, each one more challenging than the last, but a path that he would walk until the multiverse was made whole once more.
