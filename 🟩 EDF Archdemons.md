# The Demon Ascendancy

The **Demon Ascendancy** is a pantheon of seven archdemons, effectively the gods of the Empire of the Darkness Flame directly underneath the Emperor and Empress. These powerful beings embody the dark virtues that underpin the empire's religious and militaristic structure. Each archdemon represents a unique aspect of how the empire maintains dominion over its subjects:

> **Zazikel, The Destructor**
> [[游릴 EDF Zazikel]]
> *Warden of Hells*
> Zazikel oversees the infernal realms and controls the flow of Fiends from the twisting nether into imperial worlds. His primary objective is to foster Fear, Conflict, and Despair, destabilizing enemy territories and bolstering the empire's power. Known as the Devil of Devils, Zazikel thrives on chaos and destruction, permitting fiendish incursions to create turmoil that feeds his domain.

> **Lusacan, The Tormentor**
> [[游릴 EDF Lusacan]]
> *Specialist in Submission and Despair*
> Lusacan spreads despair to ensure submission, targeting the psychological and spiritual resistance of the empire's enemies. He uses torture, both physical and psychological, to break down hope and incite fear. Lusacan is also known for his deceptive tactics, often appearing in dreams and visions to manipulate and torment the faithful of other religions, ensuring no source of hope remains untainted.

> **Toth, The Flame**
> [[游릴 EDF Toth]]
> *Symbol of Conflict and Strength*
> Toth embodies the eternal struggle and the survival-of-the-fittest ideology within the empire. She perpetuates internal and external conflicts, ensuring that only the strongest prevail. Toth's presence incites wars and battles, both large and small, and she is revered by those who seek strength through adversity. Her war magic is unparalleled, and she is often invoked before major battles to inspire warriors.

> **Andoral, The Devourer**
> [[游릴 EDF Andoral]]
> *Warden of Souls*
> Andoral consumes souls and determines their fate, deciding whether they will be enslaved or destroyed. His domain thrives on the fear generated by his relentless hunger, corrupting mortals into sacrificing others to him in hopes of mercy. Andoral's soul manipulation powers are feared across the realms, and his judgment is final and brutal, ensuring that no soul escapes his grasp.

> **Dumat, The Betrayer**
> [[游릴 EDF Dumat]]
> *Manipulator of Worship and Obedience*
> Dumat makes manipulative promises to gain worship and obedience, often betraying those who outlive their usefulness. He is the first to respond to prayers from the Cult and can wield his siblings' powers when necessary. Known for his cunning and deceit, Dumat maintains the balance of power within the cult, ensuring that followers remain loyal through a mix of fear and false hope.

> **Urthemiel, The False Goddess**
> [[游릴 EDF Urthemiel]]
> *Warden of Heavens*
> Urthemiel controls the conquered Divine realms, promoting a new order that seeks to replace traditional celestial beings. She is a paragon of how anyone can ascend to godhood, encouraging mortals to overthrow old gods in favor of the empire's dominion. Urthemiel's beauty and charisma are tools for subjugation, and her divine magic undermines the power of celestial beings, reinforcing the empire's supremacy.

> **Razikale, The Executioner**
> [[游릴 EDF Razikale]]
> *Enforcer of Fear and Punishment*
> Razikale thrives on the fear of others, serving as the ultimate enforcer of punishment within the empire. Her obscurity adds to her terror, as she often strikes without warning, making examples of those who defy the empire. Razikale's void magic is a force of nature, and her presence alone can instill dread in even the bravest of souls. She ensures that the empire's laws and decrees are followed to the letter.
