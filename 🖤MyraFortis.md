#### Origins: A Warrior Born

Myra Fortis is the embodiment of raw strength and primal instinct, a warrior who thrives on the thrill of combat. From the moment she could wield a weapon, she sought out challenges that would test her mettle. For Myra, fighting is not a means to an end but an **end in itself**—a way to prove her dominance, push her limits, and revel in the chaos of battle.

She joined **Leroy Tyrannus** not out of loyalty or ambition, but because he always knew where to find the **biggest, toughest opponents**. Under Leroy’s banner, Myra gained access to conflicts that spanned realms and challenged even her formidable abilities.

#### A Battle to Remember

> External: [[Phobos🔶Wrath]]

Among Myra’s countless battles, one stands out as the most **legendary clash** of her life. While traveling to **Aeth_yr**, the realm of gods and heroes, Myra encountered **Wrath**, the daughter of **God King Kaiser Phobos, Lord of Fear**. Wrath, a godling of equal ferocity, met Myra in combat, and their fight became the stuff of legend.

- **Clash of Titans**: Their blows shattered mountains, turned rivers into boiling steam, and left craters that scarred the landscape for generations. The battle raged for days, with neither gaining the upper hand, each reveling in the other’s strength.
- **A Battle Interrupted**: The fight ended not through victory or surrender, but because both were summoned away by their respective god kings. The duel remained unresolved, leaving a **lingering rivalry** between the two warriors.

Myra rarely speaks of this encounter, though a sly grin often crosses her face when it is mentioned. She considers Wrath her **ultimate rival**, someone who could one day give her the battle to end all battles.

Myra’s role within **House Athetos** is as much a **symbolic force** as it is a practical one. She represents the chaotic, untamable power that keeps House Athetos from stagnating.

- **Turning Off Her Powers**: Myra is so confident in her abilities that she often suppresses her divine strength to make fights more challenging. She finds no joy in an easy victory, and only a true struggle can satisfy her primal instincts.
- **Unpredictable Ally**: Though loyal to Leroy and House Athetos, Myra’s impulsive nature makes her a wildcard in any situation. She is equally likely to inspire fear and admiration in her comrades.
