### Geographic and Structural Overview

Noct_yr is defined by its rugged and harsh landscapes, with the central feature being a massive palace known as the Palace of Noct_yr. This palace is a formidable fortification, equipped with endless walls, towers, and battlements, and massive arcane guns mounted on every defensible platform, emphasizing its strategic and military significance.

Surrounding the Palace on all sides are vast, layered cliffs that resemble a monumental mountain from a distance. These cliffs house entire towns and cities on their various ridges, creating a vertical civilization interconnected by bridges, lifts, and tunnels. This unique architectural feature not only serves as a defensive advantage but also as a dramatic reflection of Noct_yr's societal structure.

### Climate and Agriculture

Noct_yr suffers from a perpetual night, caused by the neglect of Sol Luxor "The Lightbreaker," the sun god of House Athetos, who has abandoned his duties to move the sun. This endless night has led the inhabitants to adapt by developing unique agricultural practices, including breeding special crops that can grow in moonlight, which sustains the populace under these extreme conditions.

### Underground Features

Beneath the palace and its mountainous surroundings, Noct_yr extends into a vast underworld ruled by Nolan Grimm "The Hand." This underworld is not only a crucial aspect of Nolan’s domain but also a strategic element of House Athetos' expansionist policies. Nolan utilizes a network of tunnels to channel heat from the infernal depths to the surface, mitigating the cold of the eternal night. Furthermore, he orchestrates the expansion of House Athetos' influence by tunneling into the underworlds of other realms, using undead soldiers and demon mercenaries to conquer and secure new territories.

### Cultural and Political Dynamics

Noct_yr’s culture is heavily influenced by the presence and governance of House Athetos. The gods of House Athetos, each with unique powers and dark backgrounds, cast a long shadow over the realm. They are revered and feared, with the local mortals desiring proximity to the Palace as a means to be closer to their gods. The ultimate honor, perceived greater than serving within the Palace, is being sacrificed to these gods, reflecting the deep-seated and grim aspects of their worship.
