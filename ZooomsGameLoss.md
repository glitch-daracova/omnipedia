# You Lose The Game

Return to: [**Zombie Outbreak on O'Mally Station**](ZooomsMain.md)

### **Game Loss Conditions**

#### **1. Major Crises and Ultimate Conditions**

- **Major Crises**: These are catastrophic events or system failures that can occur as a result of various in-game actions or the accumulation of crises over time. Examples include:
    
    - **Life Support Failure**: If the life support system fails completely and is not repaired in time, Air will deplete, eventually suffocating all survivors.
    - **Asteroid Defense Failure**: Without functional asteroid defense systems, the station may be struck by an asteroid, causing catastrophic structural damage that could lead to a total station collapse.
    - **Main Reactor Failure**: A meltdown or explosion in the main reactor would result in an uncontrollable fire or radiation leak, making the station uninhabitable and killing all survivors.
    - **Station Integrity Collapse**: This could result from a combination of factors, like severe structural damage, widespread fires, or multiple breaches that render the station beyond saving.
- **Ultimate Conditions**: Each major crisis has an ultimate condition that, if reached, results in the automatic death of all survivors, effectively ending the game. For example:
    
    - **Life Support Failure**: When Air reaches zero and cannot be restored, all survivors will eventually suffocate.
    - **Asteroid Defense Failure**: When the station takes a direct hit from an asteroid, causing critical damage that leads to the collapse of vital structures.
    - **Reactor Meltdown**: If the reactor reaches a critical state without being stabilized, it detonates, killing everyone instantly.

#### **2. Doom Table and Rolling Over 100**

- **Doom Table**: The Doom Table serves as the central mechanic for determining random events and crises as the game progresses. Every in-game hour, a player rolls 1d20, with modifiers applied as certain conditions worsen (e.g., +1 Doom Modifier).
- **Exceeding 100**:
    - **Triggering a Major Crisis**: If a roll on the Doom Table (after applying all modifiers) results in a value exceeding 100, a major crisis will automatically progress to its ultimate condition. This essentially fast-tracks a major crisis to its catastrophic end, leaving little time for players to respond.
    - **Game Loss**: If a major crisis reaches its ultimate condition, the game is lost, as all player survivors are killed either directly by the crisis or indirectly by the station’s collapse.

#### **3. Survivor Death in Regular Play**

- **Combat Encounters**:
    - **Risk**: Combat encounters with zombies or other threats can lead to player survivor deaths, either due to direct attacks, environmental hazards during combat, or poor tactical decisions.
    - **Injury and Death**: Injuries sustained in combat can be fatal if not treated, especially in prolonged engagements where resources like Ammo and Supplies are limited.
- **Consequences of Minor Crises**:
    - **Cascading Failures**: Minor crises, if left unresolved, can escalate into more serious problems, leading to situations where survivors are put in lethal danger.
    - **Individual Survivor Risks**: Non-player survivors might also perish as a result of minor crises (e.g., getting trapped in a decompression event or being overwhelmed by zombies), which could in turn reduce the available pool of replacements for player survivors.

#### **4. Final Game Loss**

- **All Player Survivors Dead**: The game is only truly lost when all possible player survivors are dead. This can happen through a combination of regular gameplay deaths (combat, minor crises) and the ultimate conditions of major crises.
- **Narrative End**: If all player survivors die, the game concludes with a narrative wrap-up of the station’s demise, reflecting the decisions and events that led to the end. This could be a somber, reflective moment for players, emphasizing the high stakes and the ultimate consequence of their decisions.

### **Strategic Implications for Players**

- **Crisis Management**: Players must prioritize which crises to address based on their potential to escalate to ultimate conditions. This adds a layer of strategy as they decide whether to tackle immediate threats or work to prevent long-term disasters.
- **Resource Allocation**: Proper management of resources like Morale, Supplies, Ammo, and Air becomes critical, especially as the game progresses and crises compound.
- **Survivor Choices**: Deciding which survivors to save or sacrifice can have long-term consequences, particularly if replacing a player survivor becomes necessary.
- **Tension and Urgency**: The constant threat of a major crisis reaching its ultimate condition, combined with the randomness of the Doom Table, keeps players on edge and heightens the overall tension of the game.
