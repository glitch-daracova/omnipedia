- **Signing of the Rubicon Agreement:** In the aftermath of unparalleled destruction, leaders from both factions recognized the necessity of imposing limits on the conduct of war. The Rubicon Agreement was drafted and signed, symbolizing a collective desire to prevent a repeat of the horrors experienced during the Age of Disaster.

- **Beginning of the New Age:** The treaty's signing marked the dawn of the New Age, a period characterized by regulated warfare, technological advancement within controlled bounds, and a cautious optimism for a more stable future.

#### Key Provisions of the Rubicon Agreement

1. **Prohibition of Breachfire Use**

   - **Definition:** Breachfire is a catastrophic force unleashed when unregulated breaches between dimensions occur, capable of obliterating entire planets and rendering them uninhabitable.

   - **Clause:** Both parties are strictly forbidden from intentionally deploying Breachfire near habitable worlds.

   - **Rationale:** The use of Breachfire during the Age of Disaster led to irreversible damage, making its prohibition essential to prevent existential threats to all intelligent life.

2. **Ban on Weaponizing the Dreamscape**

   - **Definition:** The Dreamscape is an interstitial realm where thoughts and ideas manifest as reality, accessible via devices known as Dreamcatchers. However, the vast majority of sentient beings cannot access the Dreamscape due to the rarity of Dreamcatcher technology.

   - **Clause:** The militarization of the Dreamscape is expressly prohibited. Neither side may use it to wage war, conduct espionage, or harm entities within this realm.

   - **Rationale:** Strategically inserted by Prism, this clause protects her operations within the Dreamscape. The Vex Empire, not recognizing its strategic potential, agreed without significant objection.

3. **Protection of Civilian Populations**

   - **Clause:** Direct attacks on civilian worlds not actively contributing to the war effort are forbidden. Efforts must be made to minimize collateral damage and preserve cultural, scientific, and economic centers.

   - **Rationale:** After the widespread devastation of the Age of Disaster, preserving civilian lives and infrastructure became paramount to ensure the survival and recovery of both societies.

4. **Periodic Renewal, Amendments, and Recognition**

   - **Clause:** The Rubicon Agreement is subject to periodic review and amendment to address emerging technologies and new forms of warfare. Each new Vex Emperor must formally sign the agreement upon ascension to reaffirm commitment.

   - **Current Signatory:** The current Vex Emperor and Prophet, Solren Vexaris, has upheld this tradition by signing the agreement upon his rise to power.

   - **Rationale:** This practice reinforces the treaty's significance and adapts its relevance to current leadership and technological advancements.

#### Influence on The Long War

##### Establishing Boundaries

The Rubicon Agreement set clear limits on warfare tactics, preventing the conflict from reverting to the uncontrolled chaos of the Age of Disaster. By defining unacceptable forms of warfare, it preserved the possibility of a future resolution and maintained a fragile balance of power.

##### Maintaining a Balance of Power

The treaty's provisions prevent either side from gaining an overwhelming advantage through catastrophic weapons or tactics, thereby prolonging the war but also preventing total collapse.

##### Adapting to Technological Advancements

As new weapons technology emerges, the Rubicon Agreement is amended to account for increased capacities for destruction. This ongoing adaptation keeps the treaty relevant and attempts to prevent arms races in specific types of weaponry.

##### Psychological Warfare and Exploitation

- **Strategic Amendments:** Both factions can exploit the amendment process by proposing bans on theoretical weapons, implying their own advancement in such technologies.

- **Terror Tactics:** Such implications serve as psychological tactics to instill fear and uncertainty, forcing the opponent to divert resources to counter potential threats.

#### Delay Tactics by Newly Coronated Vex Emperors

##### Leveraging Renewal for Strategic Gain

- **Delay in Signing:** Newly coronated Vex Emperors may deliberately delay renewing the Rubicon Agreement.

- **Psychological Pressure:** This delay creates uncertainty within the Xaran Alliance, as the absence of a renewed agreement opens the possibility of unrestricted warfare.

- **Forcing Concessions:** The Vex Empire uses this tactic to pressure the Xarans into accepting other negotiations or concessions before the agreement is renewed.

##### Historical Instances

- **Emperor Solren Vexaris:** While generally upholding traditions, there have been times when Solren Vexaris utilized this delay tactic to gain strategic advantages.

- **Impact on Diplomacy:** Such delays have led to intense diplomatic efforts by the Xaran Alliance, sometimes resulting in concessions on unrelated matters.

#### Physical Copies and Documentation

##### The Vellum Copy Maintained by the Vex Dynasty

- **Ceremonial Artifact:** The Vex Empire maintains a physical copy of the Rubicon Agreement, meticulously inscribed on vellum with ink. This artifact holds great ceremonial and symbolic value within the Vex dynasty.

- **Signature Tradition:** The vellum copy features a single stamped digital signature from Prism, representing the Xaran Alliance. Surrounding Prism's signature are the elegant, handwritten signatures of numerous Vex Emperors who have reigned since the treaty's inception.

- **Historical Continuity:** Over the centuries, additional pages have been added to this document to accommodate the growing list of signatories. Each new signature is a reaffirmation of the Vex Empire's commitment to the agreement, and the document serves as a tangible link to the empire's history.

- **Display and Preservation:** The vellum copy is carefully preserved and often displayed during significant state occasions, symbolizing the enduring legacy and stability of the Vex dynasty.

##### Prism's Digital Copy

- **Practical Approach:** Prism, the AI leader of the Xaran Alliance, maintains a digital copy of the Rubicon Agreement. While she treats the document with no less importance than the Vex, she approaches it with less ceremony.

- **Function over Form:** For Prism, the value of the agreement lies in its content and the obligations it imposes, rather than in physical symbolism. The digital format allows for efficient storage, replication, and reference as needed.

- **Accessibility:** Maintaining a digital copy aligns with Prism's nature as an AI and facilitates rapid dissemination of the treaty's terms to Xaran officials and military leaders, ensuring consistent adherence across the Alliance.

#### Challenges and Violations

- **Enforcement Difficulties:** With no neutral party to enforce the agreement, compliance relies on mutual interest and the threat of retaliation. Delays in renewal exacerbate enforcement challenges.

- **Exploitation of Amendments and Renewals:**

  - Psychological manipulation through proposed bans and renewal delays can escalate tensions and trigger arms races.

- **Dreamrunners and Rogue Agents:** Independent actors who exploit the Dreamscape pose constant threats, especially during periods when the agreement is not renewed.

#### Cultural and Symbolic Significance

##### Symbol of Mutual Recognition

The Rubicon Agreement symbolizes a mutual acknowledgment of each faction's sovereignty and capacity for destruction. Signing it at the end of the Age of Disaster underscores a shared desire to prevent a return to unchecked devastation.

##### Hope for Civility

For many within both societies, the agreement represents hope that civility and order can exist even in war, serving as a foundation for a more stable and secure New Age.

##### Reflection of Ideologies

- **Xaran Alliance:** The Xarans view the agreement as essential for protecting their society and values, especially after the hardships of the Age of Disaster.

- **Vex Empire:** Under Emperor Solren Vexaris, the Vex utilize the agreement and its renewal as tools for strategic advantage, aligning with their pragmatic approach to warfare.
