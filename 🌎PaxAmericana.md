Pax Americana is a powerful collection of megacities sprawling across what was once North America. It represents one of the largest and most influential regions on Terra, with its three primary megacities standing as pillars of power: **Metropolis Eboracum** (East Coast Megacity), **Aurelia Californica** (West Coast Megacity), and **Dominatus Texas** (Great Plains Megacity). Each megacity has a distinct identity, but all are united under a single banner in the New Age.

At the helm of Pax Americana is **Chad Thunder**, the Sovereign Administrator who rose to prominence during the chaotic aftermath of the Age of Disaster. Thunder began his ascent as the administrator of Dominatus Texas, a megacity known for its militaristic culture and fierce independence. From this base, he launched a relentless campaign of unification, waging war against the rival megacities of Metropolis Eboracum and Aurelia Californica. Through a combination of strategic brilliance and overwhelming force, Thunder succeeded in bringing the fractured megacities under his control, forming a unified Pax Americana.

Driven by an obsession with the legendary United States of old, Thunder believes he is revitalizing its long-forgotten ideals, casting himself as a modern-day embodiment of the nation‚Äôs strength and unity. Under his leadership, Pax Americana is not just a political entity, but a symbol of the revival of an ancient empire, reimagined for the dystopian future. However, the truth behind Thunder's vision is more complex‚Äîa rigid, authoritarian regime that uses the myth of the past to solidify its dominance over the present.

# Novus Ordo Americanum

The **Novus Ordo Americanum (NOA)** is the governing body established and controlled by **Sovereign Administrator Chad Thunder**, the central authority of Pax Americana. NOA is composed of Thunder‚Äôs closest advisors, strategists, and technocrats, all of whom are hand-selected for their loyalty, strategic insight, and unwavering commitment to his vision of a unified Pax Americana. Under NOA‚Äôs rule, the ancient ideals of governance once associated with the United States are reinterpreted through the lens of Thunder's authoritarian regime, designed to ensure absolute control over the megacities.

At the heart of NOA‚Äôs governance is the **Lex Republica**, a body of laws created by decree of Chad Thunder himself. The **Lex Republica** serves as the foundation of the legal system within Pax Americana, codifying Thunder‚Äôs vision into an unyielding set of rules and regulations that govern every aspect of life in the megacities. Though it draws upon the language of ancient republics, the Lex Republica is a tool for the consolidation of power, ensuring that the will of the Sovereign Administrator is immutable and enforced without question.

To ensure that these laws are followed, the **Ordo Imperator Lex** was established as the enforcement arm of NOA. The Ordo Imperator Lex operates as a militarized police force and legal authority, charged with maintaining order and loyalty within Pax Americana. Their mandate extends far beyond the standard duties of law enforcement‚Äîthey are empowered to carry out Thunder‚Äôs laws with absolute authority, acting as judge, jury, and executioner when necessary. The Ordo‚Äôs presence in the megacities is constant, its agents patrolling the streets to ensure compliance and to swiftly suppress any dissent.

Under Chad Thunder‚Äôs leadership, the Novus Ordo Americanum stands as a symbol of his control over Pax Americana, wielding the Lex Republica as a shield for his power and the Ordo Imperator Lex as a sword to enforce his will. What may appear as a stable government from the outside is, in reality, a tightly controlled regime where the words of the Sovereign Administrator are law and dissent is ruthlessly crushed.

# Pax Liberatis Americana

In the official rhetoric of Pax Americana, there is a phrase often repeated in state broadcasts, propaganda posters, and public speeches: **"Pax Liberatis Americana"**‚Äîa pseudo-Latin expression translating to "Peace of American Liberty." This phrase, woven into the very fabric of NOA's propaganda, evokes the imagery of ancient American ideals: freedom, peace, and self-determination. Yet, beneath the polished veneer of these words lies a stark and deliberate irony.

The "liberty" of Pax Liberatis Americana is not the freedom once cherished in the mythologized past of the United States. Instead, it has been weaponized, twisted into a tool of oppression under Chad Thunder‚Äôs regime. In the world of Pax Americana, liberty is redefined as obedience to the Lex Republica, and peace is synonymous with total control. The promise of freedom is dangled before the people as a distant ideal, something to be achieved through unquestioning loyalty to the Sovereign Administrator and unwavering acceptance of his laws.

To dissent is to defy liberty itself, at least according to the regime's propaganda. Pax Americana claims to offer "peace through order"‚Äîa peace that can only be maintained by the iron fist of the **Ordo Imperator Lex** and the unyielding force of law. In this way, the phrase **Pax Liberatis Americana** becomes a grim joke: a promise of freedom that can only be attained by surrendering all freedom, and a peace bought at the cost of constant surveillance and submission.
