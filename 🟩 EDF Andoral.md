ANDORAL _The price for weakness is damnation._ Role: Warden of Souls Title(s): The Devourer, The Shadow's Twin Domain(s): Hunger, Slavery, Corruption Channel: Souls Specialty: Soul Manipulation Personality: Wrath

His purpose is to swallow every Soul from every kill of the Imperium and judges alongside Toth the fate of the consumed: prey or Slavery. Andoralâ€™s Hunger is felt like a terrifying pull on the Soul of any who lingers too long in imperial territory, especially Imperials themselves. Over time, the Fear of his Hunger Corrupts mortals to sacrifice for Andoral, so they may be spared a cruel afterlife when he claims them upon death.

Further Corruption comes to surviving Imperials who begin to Hunger for soul-essence and magic power, tempting them to join the Cult.
