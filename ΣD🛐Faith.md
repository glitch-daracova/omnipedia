# The Faith of the Great Journey: New Earth’s Dominant Religion

On New Earth, the dominant religion is centered around **the Great Journey**, mythologizing the voyage of the Ark from Terra to Sigma Draconis as a grand, sacred odyssey. The faith tells stories of hardship, courage, and resilience, featuring **heroes and cautionary figures**—some of whom may have been real, while others exist only as symbols within its mythology. This religion serves as both a spiritual framework and a cultural identity for New Earth’s inhabitants, deeply influencing their view of life, death, and the future.

#### **Core Beliefs and Teachings**

The Faith of the Great Journey teaches that **life itself is a journey** similar to that of the ancient colonists aboard the Ark, filled with trials, choices, and unforeseen challenges. Practitioners are encouraged to view each hardship as a step on a sacred path, reflecting the perseverance of their ancestors.

- **Mythologizing the Journey**: The Great Journey is both a literal and symbolic story, with heroes embodying virtues such as courage, wisdom, and loyalty, and cautionary figures representing betrayal, hubris, or fear. These figures serve as moral guides, illustrating the virtues and vices that can either aid or hinder one’s path through life.
    
- **End Times Prophecy**: The faith speaks of a prophesied **End Times**, where humanity will face a crisis that requires embarking on a **New Great Journey**. This prophecy has both literal and allegorical interpretations, suggesting that humanity must be ready to confront whatever challenges lie ahead, either by adapting, leaving, or transcending New Earth. The End Times concept serves as a reminder to remain vigilant, unified, and prepared for an uncertain future.
    

#### **Death and the Personal Journey**

In this religion, **death** is viewed as an extension of the Great Journey—a personal passage where one’s life determines the ease or difficulty of the journey beyond.

- **The Personal Great Journey**: Followers believe that upon death, each individual embarks on a **personal Great Journey**, a sacred path where they encounter both guidance and trials based on the life they lived. The virtues or vices one embodied in life become spiritual allies or obstacles on this journey.
    
- **Moral Accountability and Afterlife**: The Faith of the Great Journey holds that one’s actions in life resonate beyond death. Those who lived with courage, compassion, and honor are believed to find peace and support on their personal journey, while those who acted with selfishness, cruelty, or cowardice face a more difficult path. This belief fosters a culture of moral accountability and self-reflection, encouraging people to live in a way that aligns with the teachings of the Great Journey.
    

#### **Rituals and Practices**

The faith has evolved a rich array of rituals and practices, each one reflecting elements of the Great Journey’s mythos. These rituals help individuals and communities connect with their heritage, their ancestors, and their own life’s journey.

- **Pilgrimage to Alsafi**: A significant ritual in this faith is the pilgrimage to **Alsafi**, where followers visit the preserved remains of the Ark. This pilgrimage is seen as a spiritual reaffirmation, allowing worshippers to symbolically follow in the footsteps of their ancestors and reflect on their own life’s path.
    
- **Death Rites and Guidance Rituals**: Death rites are highly symbolic and deeply important, with each ceremony performed as if sending the deceased on a new voyage. Priests and family members recite stories of the individual’s life, offering prayers and guidance to help ease their passage on the personal Great Journey. Loved ones often leave small tokens symbolizing virtues—such as bravery or loyalty—to “accompany” the deceased.
    
- **End Times Preparation**: Communities also hold periodic rituals that reenact the challenges of the Great Journey, reminding practitioners of the prophecy of the End Times. These reenactments involve symbolic tests of strength, resilience, and unity, meant to prepare individuals both mentally and spiritually for a potential crisis. These rituals reinforce communal bonds and serve as a reminder to remain prepared for future trials.
    

#### **Moral and Cultural Influence**

The Faith of the Great Journey has a profound impact on New Earth’s culture, shaping the values, ethics, and collective outlook of its people.

- **Unity and Perseverance**: The faith emphasizes unity and perseverance, qualities that served the Ark’s colonists in their harrowing journey to New Earth. These values encourage New Earth’s citizens to view themselves as part of a shared legacy, united by both heritage and purpose.
    
- **Preparedness and Vigilance**: The prophecy of the End Times and the teachings about death as a personal journey instill a sense of vigilance and readiness, reminding followers to remain humble, courageous, and prepared for both personal and collective challenges.
    
- **Legacy and Lineage**: The Faith of the Great Journey fosters a strong respect for ancestry, with each family viewing themselves as the “next generation” in an unbroken line stretching back to the Ark. This belief imparts a sense of duty to continue the legacy of resilience and adaptability, while honoring the sacrifices of those who came before.
