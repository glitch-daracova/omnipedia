ZAZIKEL _Claim what is yours from the weak._ Role: Warden of Hells Title(s): The Destructor, The Devil of Devils Domain(s): Fiend, Destruction, Chaos Channel: Infernal Specialty: Chaos Magic Personality: Greed

The keeper of what goes in and out of all conquered Infernal realms. All that is bound to the Imperium inevitably goes to Hell, making it their ultimate power-nexus; The Belly of the Imperium.

By nature of Chaos, Zazikel allows much freedom to the flow of Fiends from the twisting nether into imperial worlds to create more Fear, Conflict, and Despair to consume.
