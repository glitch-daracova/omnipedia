Within ORDER, **clearance levels** govern access to restricted areas, sensitive information, and specialized functions. The level system ranges from 0 to 6+, with each level allowing progressively greater access to secure zones and resources. **Overseers and Directors** operate outside this numbered system, possessing unrestricted or specific-access privileges as needed within their jurisdiction.

---

#### **Level 0**

- **Description:** Assigned to the families of ORDER employees.
- **Access:** Provides limited access to ORDERâ€™s **Lo-Sec facilities** and designated amenities, ensuring families can safely utilize ORDERâ€™s general services. Family members do not have access to Mid-Sec or higher security zones.

#### **Level 1**

- **Description:** Given to **new recruits** and **NPC (No Profound Class) employees**.
- **Access:** Grants entry to Lo-Sec areas, allowing new personnel to integrate and work within ORDERâ€™s general operational spaces. Level 1 is the baseline clearance level for any direct access within ORDER facilities.

#### **Level 2**

- **Description:** Required for personnel engaging in **training and educational programs** within Mid-Sec zones.
- **Access:** Grants access to specialized training facilities, classrooms, and low-level Mid-Sec functions, including introductory Command Language programs, breachjump training, and other skill-building resources.

#### **Levels 3-5**

- **Description:** Department-specific access, assigned to personnel based on their **assigned department** within a facility.
- **Access:** Each level in this range is typically assigned on a per-individual basis, customized according to department needs and facility security protocols. Personnel are granted access to their specific department within a facility, with Level 3 representing baseline departmental access and Level 5 enabling more restricted departmental permissions, such as access to prototype areas or sensitive research.

#### **Level 6+**

- **Description:** Required for **department managers, covert team leaders, and high-security personnel**.
- **Access:** Personnel at Level 6 or above have access to restricted zones, sensitive operations, and classified Mid-Sec and Hi-Sec data. Higher levels (6+) confer access privileges to increasingly secure areas, including critical containment units and high-security laboratories, though specific permissions are still granted on a per-role and per-mission basis.

**Note:** **Overseers and Directors** do not follow the level number system. Instead, they hold access rights according to their organizational rank, allowing them to bypass standard clearance levels within their jurisdiction. Their authority extends to all classified information and areas under their oversight, ensuring streamlined decision-making at the highest levels of ORDERâ€™s hierarchy.

### Clearance Levels 8+ (Classified)

**Clearance levels 8 and above** represent the most highly classified clearance tiers within ORDER, reserved for only the highest-ranking personnel and those with critical roles in the organizationâ€™s most sensitive operations. The existence of these levels is **itself a classified secret**â€”only personnel holding a clearance level of 8 or higher are even aware that these levels exist. Information regarding the specific permissions and roles associated with these levels is highly restricted, and access to them is granted solely by ORDERâ€™s top Overseers.

Personnel with **Level 8+ clearance** have unparalleled access to ORDERâ€™s deepest secrets, classified projects, and information vital to multiversal stability. As such, these personnel are entrusted with maintaining the strictest levels of confidentiality and security, often carrying out operations known only to a select few within the organization.
