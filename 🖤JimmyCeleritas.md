# 🖤 Jimmy Celeritas, "The Dashing"

- **Affiliation**: [🏛HouseAthetos🖤](🏛HouseAthetos🖤.md)
- **Stone**: Aquamarine
- **Power**: Speed
- **Profile**: The fastest speedster in the multiverse and self-proclaimed "sexiest god alive," Jimmy is both insufferably arrogant and undeniably effective. His speed allows him to outrun almost any threat, leaving chaos (and admirers) in his wake.

#### Origins: A God of Motion

Jimmy Celeritas embodies **speed**, the essence of motion and velocity across the multiverse. Known as the fastest being to ever exist, his feats of acceleration and agility are unparalleled. To Jimmy, speed is more than just power—it’s a **lifestyle**, a **philosophy**, and most importantly, a source of **unending swagger**.

Jimmy is unabashedly vain, calling himself the **"sexiest god alive"** with the same confidence that fuels his races. While his ego is as legendary as his speed, he is not without charm. His lighthearted, flirtatious demeanor makes him popular (or at least tolerable) among House Athetos, even if his antics occasionally veer into the realm of irritation.

#### The Quickshade Incident

> External: [🟣AzkaQuickshade](🟣AzkaQuickshade.md)

Jimmy’s reign as the fastest being in the multiverse has been virtually uncontested—until he met **Azka Quickshade**, the god of time from the rival House Yakobe. Their encounter was not a race, but a fight, one that left Jimmy **humiliated and bitter**.

- **Speed Meets Time**: Azka’s mastery over time rendered Jimmy’s speed meaningless. While Jimmy could cross galaxies in the blink of an eye, Azka could freeze, rewind, or stretch those moments to her advantage. Every move he made was anticipated and countered, leaving him helpless.
- **The Bitter Rivalry**: For Jimmy, the fight wasn’t just a defeat—it was a **cruel joke** at his expense. To lose to someone who controls time, the very denominator of speed, felt like an affront to his identity. Ever since, Jimmy has harbored a burning hatred for Azka, vowing to find a way to **even the score**.

#### Speed as a Way of Life

Jimmy’s speed defines every aspect of his existence. He moves fast, talks fast, thinks fast, and lives fast. To him, standing still is a fate worse than death. His need for motion extends beyond physical speed to his relationships, decisions, and goals—he is always chasing something, whether it’s a challenge, a conquest, or his next witty quip.

- **Competitions and Races**: Jimmy thrives on challenges, relishing any opportunity to prove his dominance. He’s never lost a race, and his victories are as much about his own ego as they are about showcasing his divine power.
- **Flirting and Flashiness**: True to his persona, Jimmy is a shameless flirt, often combining his charm and speed to impress others. His flamboyant entrances and dramatic exits are legendary, ensuring that he is never overlooked.

#### Strengths and Weaknesses

- **Strengths**: Jimmy’s speed is unmatched, allowing him to traverse realms, dodge attacks, and outpace virtually any threat. His charisma and humor make him a disarming presence, even among enemies.
- **Weaknesses**: His ego and impulsiveness often lead him into unnecessary conflicts or reckless decisions. His obsession with Azka Quickshade borders on self-destructive, distracting him from more important matters.

#### The Chase for Revenge

Jimmy’s rivalry with Azka Quickshade has become his driving obsession. While he masks his bitterness with bravado, his determination to defeat her is **all-consuming**. He has scoured the multiverse for artifacts, allies, and strategies that might give him an edge, though so far, nothing has leveled the playing field.

- **Humor as a Mask**: Jimmy’s humor and cocky attitude hide the sting of his defeat. Though he rarely shows vulnerability, his grudge against Azka reveals a deeper insecurity about his identity and the limits of his power.
- **An Ongoing Quest**: Jimmy’s pursuit of vengeance has led him to experiment with manipulating time itself, a dangerous endeavor that threatens to undermine his natural abilities.

#### Legacy and Influence

Jimmy Celeritas is a paradox: a god who moves faster than anyone else, yet cannot outrun the shadow of his humiliation. His charm, speed, and audacity make him an iconic figure in **House Athetos**, but his grudge against Azka Quickshade hints at the vulnerabilities beneath his confident exterior.

For now, Jimmy remains the fastest god alive, a streak of light that blazes across the multiverse, leaving a trail of admirers, rivals, and unresolved challenges in his wake. Whether he can ever overcome his bitterness—or truly outrun his past—remains to be seen.
